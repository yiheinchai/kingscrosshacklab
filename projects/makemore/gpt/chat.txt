[15/8/25, 10:48:58] ~ Adam: ‎Niv Ucl Builder added ~ Adam
[15/8/25, 20:07:23] ~ Adam: So what's the actual constitution for this thing is it UCL based or kings cross area or what
[15/8/25, 20:07:34] ~ Adam: Cus I love the concept
[15/8/25, 20:16:31] Yi Hein: We would hold some sessions at Kings Cross. We are starting with UCL as a base first, due to room booking logistics, but planning to expand beyond UCL once we get traction
[15/8/25, 20:16:59] Yi Hein: Goal is to get the most cracked people across unis together in one place and let the magic happen
[15/8/25, 20:17:43] ~ Adam: Where in kings x?
[15/8/25, 20:18:11] Niv Ucl Builder: adam are you free to call
[15/8/25, 20:18:13] ~ Adam: You could make it a soc if you want UCL room bookings
[15/8/25, 20:18:19] ~ Adam: Uh I'm on a national express coach
[15/8/25, 20:18:26] ~ Adam: So not really right now
[15/8/25, 20:18:33] Niv Ucl Builder: oh shit. no worries. well explain over message then
‎[15/8/25, 20:19:15] Yi Hein: ‎image omitted
[15/8/25, 20:19:17] Yi Hein: Here
[15/8/25, 20:19:20] Niv Ucl Builder: yeah we originally planned to be at kings cross though logistically its not the easiest place to host stuff at
[15/8/25, 20:20:20] ~ Adam: Woah sick
[15/8/25, 20:20:39] ~ Adam: Especially w English weather amarite
[15/8/25, 20:21:05] Niv Ucl Builder: INNIT and that wasnt even the biggest challenge
[15/8/25, 20:21:09] ~ Adam: Is it a club or lab
[15/8/25, 20:21:41] Niv Ucl Builder: apparently almost all if kings cross is owned by a private entity so its not technically public space
[15/8/25, 20:21:45] Niv Ucl Builder: making it even harder
[15/8/25, 20:21:59] ~ Adam: Making it a soc at UCL might be a good way to start
[15/8/25, 20:22:11] Niv Ucl Builder: hmmm were not too sure ourselves. probably closer to the former
[15/8/25, 20:22:15] ~ Adam: Or you could reach out to computer science society and ask them
[15/8/25, 20:22:24] Niv Ucl Builder: though if youre interested
[15/8/25, 20:22:32] Niv Ucl Builder: we are having our first pilot session soon
[15/8/25, 20:22:34] ~ Adam: What are your courses?
[15/8/25, 20:22:38] ~ Adam: When and where
[15/8/25, 20:23:51] Niv Ucl Builder: UCL Cruciform hub, august 18th, 2-6pm
[15/8/25, 20:23:58] Niv Ucl Builder: we are also hosting it online
[15/8/25, 20:23:58] ~ Adam: There are a surprising amount of cafes and places like that that have a lot of unused seeting a lot of the time out of season etc
[15/8/25, 20:24:16] Niv Ucl Builder: WE TRIED TO ACC GO TO THEM TOO
[15/8/25, 20:24:27] Niv Ucl Builder: and we are in the talks
[15/8/25, 20:24:33] ~ Adam: I have an internship finishes at 5:30

[15/8/25, 20:25:00] ~ Adam: Of course they're not gonna say no
[15/8/25, 20:25:20] ~ Adam: Pull up and dare them to care, buy one coffee for 5 hours that's literally fine
[15/8/25, 20:25:22] Yi Hein: We can still use kings cross area, there is an area with umbrellas
[15/8/25, 20:25:35] Yi Hein: We just can’t put up the banner
[15/8/25, 20:25:38] ~ Adam: True could be nice
[15/8/25, 20:25:41] Yi Hein: But we plan to have shirts
[15/8/25, 20:25:47] Yi Hein: With the advertising on the back
[15/8/25, 20:25:51] ~ Adam: Coding outside feels iffy ykwim
[15/8/25, 20:26:01] Yi Hein: Yeah that’s true too
[15/8/25, 20:26:12] ~ Adam: Aha fun
[15/8/25, 20:28:43] Niv Ucl Builder: you know what, thats acc quite a similar idea to one that we had. we might experiment on this too during one of our other pilots ‎<This message was edited>
[15/8/25, 20:29:27] Yi Hein: yeah but for now, we are based at cruciform winner study room, it has a projector and external monitors
[15/8/25, 20:29:51] ~ Adam: Yeah like you'll see ice cream shops Waterstones Joe and the juices all with empty rooms of seating midweek it's silly
[15/8/25, 20:30:23] ~ Adam: It can also be an ad hoc thing I'm personally just looking for someone to hold me a bit accountable to my projects lol
[15/8/25, 20:30:43] ~ Adam: Pretty good
[15/8/25, 20:30:47] Yi Hein: Yeah exactly same for me haha

[15/8/25, 20:35:24] ~ Adam: Ooh how
[15/8/25, 20:35:59] Yi Hein: just inspect the request from the phone
[15/8/25, 20:36:04] Yi Hein: And replicate it
[15/8/25, 20:36:11] ~ Adam: Oh the API is public
[15/8/25, 20:36:28] ~ Adam: Wdym am I misunderstanding
[15/8/25, 20:37:21] Yi Hein: Like when you unlock a bike on your phone, u use a proxy to intercept the request to see the parameters
[15/8/25, 20:37:46] ~ Adam: Oh nice I'm curious to see what that looks like
[15/8/25, 20:37:55] ~ Adam: Uh haven't done much messing around with proxys
[15/8/25, 20:39:43] Niv Ucl Builder: ah i see, i remember back in the day when you could intercept car key signals
[15/8/25, 20:39:47] Niv Ucl Builder: or cloning nfcs
[15/8/25, 20:40:15] Niv Ucl Builder: ah this sounds really cool

[15/8/25, 20:43:04] ~ Adam: I make it more difficult for myself to get underway cus I do a fuck ton of societies at UCL so getting starting or continuing gets a bit in my head the more I wait ykwim
[15/8/25, 20:43:11] ~ Adam: Nice

[15/8/25, 20:46:49] Niv Ucl Builder: think solving puzzles to gain access to the sign up url. 

qr codes with no context in and around places where we want traction. 

smth like find the name of the picture in this place, remove spaces and add a .com to get access to the sign up url.

[15/8/25, 20:52:59] ~ Adam: Yeah I get that this all sounds really nice
[15/8/25, 20:53:05] Niv Ucl Builder: sure, ill send you details once i have them

[30/10/25, 08:26:12] ~ David L: Heya builders! 

I’m David and I met a few of you a few weeks ago. I’m passionate about Venture Capital and enabling builders to be better connected for funding. I’ve been elected as the president of the VC & PE club this year and want to share our first event on the 11/11/25 6pm in canary wharf campus.

See details below!

*Interested in Venture Capital? Come to UCL’s VC & PE club’s kick off event 🎉*

Join us for an inspiring fireside chat with an amazing panel of speakers sharing their personal journeys on how they broke into venture capital — followed by networking and drinks.

📅 Tuesday, 11th November
🕕 6:00 PM

Spots are limited, so grab yours before the management students swarm in later! 😉

Booking Link: https://luma.com/ydf9zki5(Please make sure a correct email is entered in order for you to receive a guest pass to enter the building. Your UCL ID will not work. Passes are sent approx 24hrs in advance.)

[31/10/25, 03:35:27] Haziq KXHL: Oooo sounds fun!
Is this similar to the Tuesday session or something different?
[31/10/25, 03:36:58] Haziq KXHL: Btw 2nd floor meaning the mezzanine or the actual second floor??
Just wanna know if I need my UCL ID to get in…
[31/10/25, 03:39:46] Haziq KXHL: Also 8pm is kinda late no? 😆 will @⁨Niv Ucl Builder⁩ be kind enough to provide his patent-pending “caffeine” pills? Cos I’d pay good money for that and I’m pretty sure it contains a little more than just caffeine & L-Theanine 🤭
[31/10/25, 03:47:34] Haziq KXHL: The VCs in the chat probably sweating buckets and ringing their legal teams… while also secretly wondering if they should pivot to ‘pharmaceutical innovation’ 👀💊
[31/10/25, 03:49:25] Haziq KXHL: Alsooo who else is coming?? I’m new here so would be nice to meet the rest of KXHL!

[31/10/25, 10:53:03] Yi Hein: the Tuesday session is more of social, getting to know more members and finding people with similar project interests
[31/10/25, 10:54:49] Yi Hein: ^ also to facilitate everyone finding the group of people with similar project interests, please fill out this 1 min Google form, we will be creating a hacker directory

[31/10/25, 11:40:58] ~ Arhaan: Is Linux worth switching to? Windows is so bloated and it starts doing random stuff like creating github repos in my onedrive 💀
[31/10/25, 11:44:37] Haziq KXHL: Omg just that very question can get you kicked out of this GC 🤣🤣 you’re surrounded by Arch ricing psychopaths 🔪 ‎<This message was edited>

[31/10/25, 12:46:23] ~ Arhaan: I have heard that like the setup is quite annoying for Linux and there are some software compatability issues
[31/10/25, 12:46:46] ~ Arhaan: Is that just dependent on the one you use?
[31/10/25, 12:47:11] Eli KXHL: Keep windows, unless ur a hardcore swe i wouldnt touch it, its more annoying then anything
[31/10/25, 12:47:23] ~ Arhaan: Fair
[31/10/25, 12:48:05] ~ Arhaan: How do I make windows less bloated
[31/10/25, 12:48:26] Haziq KXHL: If a software is not compatible with Linux, then that software is probably not worth using 💁‍♂️ 
#based
[31/10/25, 12:49:34] Haziq KXHL: Wait are y’all not hardcore SWEs, am I in the wrong GC or something??
Is this the crochet and knitting group? 🧐

In fact I have a curated collection of crochet shirts 🤓
[31/10/25, 12:55:08] ~ samia 💗🌸: Shirts is a new level
[31/10/25, 12:56:27] ~ samia 💗🌸: You should make a business out of it
[31/10/25, 12:59:32] Eli KXHL: Best swes use mac 🦦
[31/10/25, 13:00:54] Haziq KXHL: lol no I don’t know how to make them, just how to rock them 🤭 pretty sure the modelling industry isn’t ready for this level of crochet couture 😌

[31/10/25, 13:27:14] ~ .: Hey, genuine question

[31/10/25, 13:28:37] ~ .: The UI generated is so bad
[31/10/25, 13:32:56] Yi Hein: use claude 4/4.5, paste a picture of a really good UI, and ask it to use the same style. or mention a well known website with a good UI

[31/10/25, 15:56:01] Yi Hein: i’m setting up a 24/7 hacker space in the student centre. i have an room booking bot that can reserve and check in on the rooms automatically.

each person can book a room for 3 hours, so if 8 people participate, we can book a room 24/7/365. (will require you to sign into ucl email on the server)

react  🙋‍♂️ to this message if you want to join in, in creating this space
[31/10/25, 15:56:51] Niv Ucl Builder: cool idea!
[31/10/25, 15:57:21] Yi Hein: Well put the banner in the room to mark our territory
[31/10/25, 15:59:51] Eli KXHL: Sounds great
[31/10/25, 16:08:33] Yi Hein: *REMINDER*

🚨 spontaneous overnight hack session

today (friday), student centre, 2nd floor, starting 6pm

@⁨Eli KXHL⁩ and I will be building interactive world models from scratch
[31/10/25, 16:08:38] Yi Hein: we are starting earlier at 6pm
[31/10/25, 18:16:50] Haziq KXHL: Where in the second floor??
[31/10/25, 18:20:01] Eli KXHL: Im here
[31/10/25, 18:29:35] Yi Hein: Ok I just arrived
[31/10/25, 18:31:40] Yi Hein: Guys I’ve a room here in science library

[1/11/25, 09:27:05] Haziq KXHL: @⁨Yi Hein⁩ here’s an idea…
How about we have like a maths x machine learning problem set during the more social meet-ups??
I thought it would be useful cos primary literature in ML is quite mathy and we’ve got people from all STEM fields here
[1/11/25, 09:28:43] Haziq KXHL: At the level of “Mathematics for Machine Learning” by Deisenroth for starters.
Maybe stuff like Bishop’s PRML or Info. Theory (MacKay) in the future
[1/11/25, 09:47:04] Yi Hein: yeah agreed, generally math that is useful to help people achieve the project they are working on
[1/11/25, 09:47:35] Yi Hein: just gotta be very focused and directed to what is useful for the project, because there is so much math out there
[1/11/25, 09:48:28] Yi Hein: also wonder if people are interested in programming tutorials, since i gather that quite a few people want to learn to become technical and start building ‎<This message was edited>
[1/11/25, 10:05:09] Haziq KXHL: Cool 👌 
I’ll try to whip something up for next Tuesday. This is actually right up my alley cos I moonlight as a high school math tutor 😆
[1/11/25, 10:10:00] Haziq KXHL: Sounds super fun, what sorta stuff are you thinking?
If it’s on topics like the interactive worlds models you were building then I’d totally attend 🙏

[1/11/25, 12:49:19] ~ Arhaan: In ml, is it mainly LA, probability , calculus that is useful. I have heard of people trying to use graph theory or topology to make deep learning models more efficient
[1/11/25, 13:11:18] Haziq KXHL: Yeah those three are canon and will get you through most deep learning texts. I believe you may be alluding to work from Prof. Bronstein’s group at DeepMind x Oxford University (Geometric deep learning). Very interesting stuff indeed!
[1/11/25, 13:11:56] Haziq KXHL: https://www.monterosatx.com/
[1/11/25, 13:12:26] Haziq KXHL: This biotech startup is applying this area of research to make protein degrader therapies - just wow 🤩
[1/11/25, 13:52:07] Yi Hein: That’s really cool!
[1/11/25, 13:52:35] ~ Arhaan: Really  interesting
[1/11/25, 13:53:26] Yi Hein: @⁨Haziq KXHL⁩ have you seen Synthase? UCL spin off startup, for automated experiments. So you get Experiments As Code
[1/11/25, 13:54:15] ~ Arhaan: I saw this other company (I think dxcover) who are trying to create a new type of blood biopsy that uses infrared spectroscopy and ML to detect cancer at earlier stages.
[1/11/25, 13:55:18] ~ Arhaan: I know topology can be used to model stuff like intestines which is cool. (I might be mistaken)
[1/11/25, 15:48:00] Haziq KXHL: Haha yes I’ve got a friend who can’t stop talking about it, lots of people from my iGEM days working on cloud/robotic labs. I actually got a quote from one for my own pre-seed pitch 😆 Emerald is the big player in this space.
It’s an exciting prospect really… for biotech startups - getting wet lab data practically overnight with 100% reproducibility and transparency (think vibe-biology). We were literally planning to de-risk our concept without stepping into the wet lab but no funding 😭💔 ‎<This message was edited>
‎[1/11/25, 15:52:40] Haziq KXHL: Copy of VCL demo day Phate.bio Engineering the Potential of Life.pdf • ‎13 pages ‎document omitted
[1/11/25, 15:53:58] Haziq KXHL: OMG bro, tysm for bringing that up 🤣
That’s literally what I’m working on nowadays… wait I gotta run now but ill elaborate soon
[1/11/25, 15:54:25] ~ Hameem: Crazy how he studied the same degree as I do lol
[1/11/25, 15:55:35] ~ Arhaan: I am not entirely sure it that is exactly what they do, but I remember seeing something of the sorts
[1/11/25, 16:51:41] Haziq KXHL: Oh interesting 🤷‍♂️ would like to see the reference for that…
But topology is used in a more abstract sense like to impose priors (constraints) - topological invariants and so on
[1/11/25, 16:52:35] ~ Arhaan: Sorry I may be wrong as I don't know much about topology
[1/11/25, 16:53:42] Haziq KXHL: No worries at all, we’re all just figuring stuff out 🤗🤝
[1/11/25, 16:53:46] ~ Arhaan: https://hal.science/hal-00348152/file/Poudret-LATA07.pdf
[1/11/25, 17:42:53] Haziq KXHL: Thx for the reference, I’ll give this a read
[1/11/25, 17:47:32] Haziq KXHL: basically we’re doing something similar but with Raman spectroscopy… it’s what my personal tutor Prof. Geraint Thomas is working on…
‎[1/11/25, 17:47:44] Haziq KXHL: cancers-15-01720-with-cover.pdf • ‎17 pages ‎document omitted
[1/11/25, 17:55:46] Haziq KXHL: tl;dr for anyone interested:
Shine a monochromatic laser on a sample; some scattered light shifts in frequency (Raman scattering) because molecular vibrations exchange energy with the photons. The graph that you get that shows the intensity x wavenumbers of the scattered light is the Raman spectra

There’s a growing body of literature on how we can use Raman spectra to try and stratify cancer subtypes. This paper focuses on colorectal cancer
[1/11/25, 17:58:16] Haziq KXHL: But here’s the catch… we’re not interested in diagnostics or liquid biopsy like dxcover and others. We’re sketchier than that 😏
[1/11/25, 18:00:04] Haziq KXHL: We wanna feed these spectra into computer vision models to classify them but only to use “explainable AI” techniques to backtrack and figure out which regions of the spectra the AI is basing its stratification on. Those are potential targets for drug development
[1/11/25, 21:06:19] Haziq KXHL: @⁨~Arhaan⁩ what’s your field btw? Are you working on stuff like this I.e. systems biology?
[1/11/25, 22:14:40] ~ Arhaan: No , I am a first year maths and stats
[2/11/25, 00:23:41] ~ Arhaan: I was thinking of learning some c. I want try making my own linalg library or do something more interesting. Is it worth learning it. I already have some familiarity with c-styled languages like c#
[2/11/25, 00:25:29] ~ .: C++ is a way better option imo
[2/11/25, 00:25:49] ~ .: Way better functionality while maintaining the low levelness of C
[2/11/25, 00:26:33] ~ .: But that’s just my two cents as someone who used C++
[2/11/25, 00:26:57] ~ .: I personally found C++ way more enjoyable than python ‎<This message was edited>
[2/11/25, 00:30:35] ~ Arhaan: I thought c++ was like really annoying due to the memory issues, is that also the case with c? I thought that c might have been better as it is like subset of c++.
[2/11/25, 00:30:46] ~ .: No it’s worse honestly
[2/11/25, 00:31:04] ~ .: You don’t have things like shared_ptr
[2/11/25, 00:31:27] ~ .: C++ is derived from C, not the other way around
[2/11/25, 00:36:31] ~ Arhaan: Yes but is c++ not meant to be a superset of c, in terms of functionality?
[2/11/25, 01:57:54] Alex KXHL: C also has manual memory management
[2/11/25, 01:58:16] Alex KXHL: But cpp gives extra tools to manage memory (smart pointers)
[2/11/25, 01:59:19] ~ Arhaan: Cool
[2/11/25, 01:59:22] ~ Arhaan: Ty
[2/11/25, 02:02:02] Alex KXHL: c is like the most minimal language, there's like barely any features and that's the main strength and weakness ‎<This message was edited>
[2/11/25, 02:02:23] Alex KXHL: but like for ease of development, being efficient with time and sanity preservation, i'd recommend cpp
[2/11/25, 02:03:05] Alex KXHL: like you get oop, the smart pointers, massive standard library, almost every language feature ever ‎<This message was edited>

@⁨Haziq KXHL⁩ 
sorry this is the paper/concept I was talking about. Using topology to model/study colorectal cancer. Although I don't know much about topology or colorectal cancer :).
[2/11/25, 17:34:20] Haziq KXHL: Oh thanks so much man, yeah it’s a pretty involved paper ☠️ will definitely give it read
[2/11/25, 17:36:44] Haziq KXHL: Btw noticed you’re into quantum computing/information theory. That’s awesome 🙌 I’ve read sporadically on the topic but keep forgetting the important theorems 🤦‍♂️😆 we ought to do some problem sets on that sometime and also Qiskit tutorials
[2/11/25, 17:37:34] Haziq KXHL: Btw you down for that mathematics for machine learning problem set next Tuesday?? cooking it up as we speak 👨‍🍳 ‎<This message was edited>
[2/11/25, 18:46:22] ~ Arhaan: Yh , quantum computung seems really interesting. Especially it's implications in scientific simulations. Although I don't really understand how it works , like boch sphere representation and the gates. I haven't really read much about it but will look into it later this week
[2/11/25, 18:47:52] ~ Arhaan: Sure , how much LA and stats are needed? I still need to learn  things like svd and other stuff.
[2/11/25, 19:50:03] Haziq KXHL: Was thinking we’d start with basic linear algebra… chapter 2 of Deisenroth should suffice
[2/11/25, 19:58:27] ~ Arhaan: Ok cause my LA course is really proof based
[2/11/25, 20:03:37] Haziq KXHL: 🙌 Then it should be cakewalk for you, maybe we can do more proof based stuff in subsequent weeks
[2/11/25, 20:05:18] ~ samia 💗🌸: Hey all , sorry to divert any discussion but what is the day of our next session if it’s been confirmed
[2/11/25, 20:10:18] ~ Arhaan: Nah like we have only gotten to like row spaces and rank nulity.
[2/11/25, 20:10:29] ~ Arhaan: I think Tuesday
[2/11/25, 20:11:54] Eli KXHL: In second semester i can do a more advanced one for u guys if u want, like short 10-20 min ones on more advanced math underpinning important concepts. Once ur done with the basics ‎<This message was edited>
[2/11/25, 20:12:12] Haziq KXHL: Please do share any resources that you find useful on this topic, would love to delve into it further!
[2/11/25, 20:12:37] Haziq KXHL: Wow that would super useful, thanks so much Eli!! 🙏
[2/11/25, 20:37:08] ~ Arhaan: I would say that I am in a similar boat. I think IBM has some good resources relating to qiskit
[3/11/25, 00:14:55] Yi Hein:
[3/11/25, 00:15:55] Yi Hein: Hey everyone, our next session will be tomorrow (Tuesday) 5.30pm, we’ll meet at the refractory. We will be doing 3x Pomodoro cycles.

At 7pm, we’ll go for our third *social* to get to know each other better ‎<This message was edited>
[3/11/25, 00:18:00] ~ Adam: AHA YES I CAN MAKE THIS ONE
[3/11/25, 00:18:08] ~ Adam: IM BRINGING THE MECHANICAL KEYBOARD
[3/11/25, 00:21:41] Alex KXHL: First???

[3/11/25, 00:22:19] Alex KXHL: Hehe
[3/11/25, 05:49:10] Haziq KXHL: R.e. linear algebra practice. This is the progression I have in mind

• 💀 https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-s096-matrix-calculus-for-machine-learning-and-beyond-january-iap-2023/

I reckon we’ll end up doing 5-10 PSets on each of this, one every week but let’s see how it goes…
[3/11/25, 05:52:02] Haziq KXHL: IM BRINGING A PLUSHIE 🧸
[3/11/25, 07:31:43] ~ Arhaan: I have heard strang's book is quite good
[3/11/25, 07:32:33] ~ Arhaan: MIT opencourseware is goated
[3/11/25, 07:35:56] Haziq KXHL: Yeah I did his course long back and absolutely loved it 🤌 but then got into biosciences and forgot most of it 🤦‍♂️ so tryna relearn
[3/11/25, 07:36:56] Haziq KXHL: Maybe a little too much compSci/engineering flavour for your taste if you’re partial to proof based classes
[3/11/25, 07:43:29] ~ Arhaan: I honestly don't mind both. I just don't like doing computation by hand. It just gets boring
[3/11/25, 08:03:11] Haziq KXHL: lol yeah I feel you, lots of problems in Strang are solved by Gauss Jordan & RREF and it’s a grind 😰
[3/11/25, 08:03:38] Haziq KXHL: But it’s a rite of passage though 😆 I’m learning to love it
[3/11/25, 08:12:26] ~ Arhaan: Yeah but like if you already know how to do it , why do I have to do it by hand 😭. Like I don't want to be putting a 9x9 matrix into RREF by hand.
[3/11/25, 08:48:10] ~ Arhaan: Hey I have a question. Currently working through the scikit & pytorch O'Reilly book. Currently doing cali housing prices regression model stuff. I haven't finished yet so this might come up later, will doing a box-cox transform of my data make my regression model better, because my data will then be more symmetric? ‎<This message was edited>
[3/11/25, 09:08:55] Haziq KXHL: Ok here’s the deal… so we use box-cox cos we wanna use linear regression but the input-output relationship is kinda curvy yes?

But linear regression assumes additive + homoscedastic noise (not as fancy as it sounds, look it up). This no longer holds post transformation so that’s why this method is kind of ad-hoc and we’re better off fitting a more flexible function to the untransformed data.

Like take the special case, lambda = 0 of box-cox and that’s just a log transform. A fixed error epsilon has a big effect in lower values of the input space but practically negligible at higher values. Think about what happens when you take log(1 + 0.1) vs. Log(10000 + 0.1). This is due to the “diminishing returns” (everywhere monotonically increasing and negative 2nd derivative) property of the log function. But essentially your regression is gonna biased such that the model is more lenient towards errors at higher values of the input space which is like a really undesirable property ‎<This message was edited>
[3/11/25, 09:14:08] Haziq KXHL: So box-cox is taught for historical reasons mostly, better off fitting a more flexible function (polynomial regression… 🤷‍♂️) to data directly or using transformations that are faithful to the original noise
‎[3/11/25, 09:17:59] Haziq KXHL: Little experiment that shows this effect… ‎image omitted
[3/11/25, 09:19:15] Haziq KXHL: Hope that’s helpful bro, apologies for the scrappy answer 😅 typing between sets of bench press 🤦‍♂️
[3/11/25, 09:36:35] ~ Arhaan: This is just repeating what you said. So in the log case the error has a way a bigger effect in lower input values, so the curve generated will kind of prioritise fitting that? Maybe in that interval of small values it is better however overall it does worse off?
[3/11/25, 09:36:50] ~ Arhaan: Thank you so much , sorry for troubling you during your workout
[3/11/25, 09:39:14] ~ Arhaan: I have an additional question on polynomial regression. Is there like a double descent effect with polynomial regression. Like if I had a 6 data points , we would see improvements in the regression model till the 6th degree polynomial however after that the effectiveness might drop.  But what if I had like a 100th degree polynomial?
[3/11/25, 09:40:44] Haziq KXHL: Spot on 🙌
[3/11/25, 09:47:26] Haziq KXHL: Hey no worries man 😇 just tryna juggle STEM life and my future Olympic debut 🫣
[3/11/25, 09:47:51] Haziq KXHL: Okk… one word: overfitting.
‎[3/11/25, 09:48:39] Haziq KXHL: ‎image omitted
[3/11/25, 09:50:21] Haziq KXHL: Give the model too much flexibility and it’ll start fitting the signal and noise 😰
But your error will keep decreasing though, that’s why we split the data into train/test/val to see how well it generalises
[3/11/25, 09:51:52] ~ Arhaan: Okie 👍 . What if we were to like get batches of training data and train a really flexible model across these batches. Would could it prevent this issue?
[3/11/25, 09:52:05] ~ Arhaan: Cool, what sport?
[3/11/25, 10:01:10] Haziq KXHL: Okay so that’s basically akin to just using a bigger dataset… and yes there are theoretical results that show that as your training dataset becomes infinitely large the training set error converges to the actual expected error. But in practice datasets are not infinitely large obviously so the validation set error is a more unbiased approximator
[3/11/25, 10:08:49] Haziq KXHL: Thx for asking 😊
I’m an ex runner and currently into powerlifting… I’ve got a strong deadlift and pull-up so looking to get into speed climbing in the future. Bench press is just for main character energy 😆
[3/11/25, 10:10:10] Haziq KXHL: Hbu? What hobbies/sports are you into?
[3/11/25, 10:13:03] ~ Arhaan: That is pretty cool. I wouldn't say I am that sporty but I have recently gotten into bouldering which is quite fun. Would like to try mountaineering/climbing. Also need to get into the gym
[4/11/25, 14:20:36] Yi Hein: Hi all, reminder that this will be happening today at 5.30pm, let meet in the refractory
[4/11/25, 17:04:24] Yi Hein: I’ve arrived early, I’m gonna be outside printroom cafe first, will be moving the refractory after

I’m gonna try but I’d say my chances are pretty slim as first year undergrad given other applicants are PhDs, postdocs etc.
Good luck to all of us ✌️ it’s a very prestigious competition indeed

[5/11/25, 10:01:10] ~ Arhaan: Wait so am I cooked cause I am like a first yr. I went to a hackathon last week and that ended up being a disaster
[5/11/25, 10:32:23] Haziq KXHL: hey hey hi yes hello 👋 certified walking disaster here

ok so when i said “prestigious” I meant like…
ARIA x PillarVC prestigious 😭

ARIA = currently the most cracked R&D entity in the UK. taxpayer funded but somehow answers to no one?? just out here casually throwing £100m at “what if planes never landed lol”

PillarVC = fund with half a billion dollars sitting around like “go play, kids, build something shiny”

so yeah the comps gonna be tough and like idk if we’ll even get in BUT the impostor syndrome?? lean into it.

if they think our project is mid then wow haha jokes on them because we were literally *never supposed to be in the room anyway* 😆 like pls we are just first years, we are here for vibes and chaos ‎<This message was edited>
[5/11/25, 10:46:54] Haziq KXHL: oh and i'm also a fresher albeit a little older (turning 20 next week) since I took a gap year...
btw what privileges does turning 20 unlock, do any of you know? like can i cross the road alone and stuff??
Like istg my parents still instinctively grab my hand when crossing the road 🤣 and I'm like 🙄😤

[10/11/25, 14:54:20] Haziq KXHL: ⚡️ Lightning Lecture: Prof. Paul Dalby ⚡️

Topic: Design and Optimisation of Developable and Manufacturable Biologics
🧬 When cutting-edge drug design meets real-world manufacturing.

Join us for a special Lightning Lecture with Prof. Paul Dalby, Deputy Head of UCL Biochemical Engineering and Co-Director of the EPSRC Future Targeted Healthcare Manufacturing Hub. Prof. Dalby is a global leader in biopharmaceutical process development, bridging molecular design, protein engineering, and manufacturability.

With over two decades at UCL, he’s helped shape how the next generation of biologics—from monoclonal antibodies to complex protein therapeutics—are designed not just to work, but to be made efficiently, sustainably, and at scale.

Expect insights on:

- How molecular and process design interconnect in biopharma R&D

- Strategies to enhance developability and stability of biologics

- Case studies from industry collaborations via the Targeted Healthcare Hub

- Where AI, automation, and synthetic biology fit into the next wave of biologics manufacturing

🎤 About the Speaker:
Prof. Dalby completed his PhD under Sir Alan Fersht at Cambridge’s MRC Centre for Protein Engineering, later conducting postdoctoral work at the University of Pennsylvania. Since joining UCL in 2000, he’s served in major leadership roles across UKRI, EPSRC, RSC, and BBSRC, mentoring countless engineers and scientists driving forward the biologics revolution.

on the continuity of the phenotype space... cell identity is the canvas and transcription factors are the paintbrushes. In other words, "franken-cells" but like without touching the genome. cell fate engineering > gene editing. Anyways that was the premise of my failed startup idea 😓

[23/11/25, 14:36:39] Yi Hein: maybe do thiel fellowship or something
[23/11/25, 14:37:11] Haziq KXHL: Bro I got into z fellows and told them I changed my mind you guys are weirdos
[23/11/25, 14:37:52] Yi Hein: yeah but $200k is about the same as some grant money for PIs, so you can start a lab immediately
[23/11/25, 14:40:00] Haziq KXHL: That’s like hardly enough to run a lab for year… lab rent, wet lab personnel, consumables, etc. - I’ve done the math for my pre seed pitch
[23/11/25, 14:40:52] Haziq KXHL: Also I don’t take money from psychopathic weapons dealers 🤷‍♂️

[29/11/25, 10:14:37] Yi Hein: @⁨Niv Ucl Builder⁩ I think problem with text-based action agents lacks the abstraction layer of the spinal cord (for target-muscle contraction mapping) and the abstraction of basal ganglia for sequence learning
[29/11/25, 10:15:57] Yi Hein: we could probably get much better compositional generalisation by adding those abstraction layers in
[30/11/25, 08:13:01] Niv Ucl Builder: i swear I read a paper that tried to implement this sequencelike learning. ill see if i can try finding it
[30/11/25, 08:13:15] Niv Ucl Builder: but i think youre right
[30/11/25, 18:32:29] Haziq KXHL: @⁨Niv Ucl Builder⁩ @⁨Yi Hein⁩ if it’s just the three of us in one more sesh istg I’m renaming this to Cognitive Computational Neuro Club. AGI can fill in for all the slackers and no-shows 😤

[30/11/25, 21:27:27] Haziq KXHL: I was super into this stuff cos I was in an operations research intern in a delivery company (like uber eats but in MENA)

[30/11/25, 21:40:04] ~ Arhaan: There was a talk about them in physics soc. Someone from deepmind came to talk about them

[30/11/25, 21:41:50] ~ Arhaan: He was really nice
[30/11/25, 21:48:48] Haziq KXHL: i acc think it would be fun for us to go cos it’s gonna be so corporate and banal

[30/11/25, 21:49:37] Niv Ucl Builder: sounds cool, lets do it. we can try getting more people too

[6/12/25, 10:16:30] ~ David L: Any themes/ format? Havent been to one, whats to be expected?
[6/12/25, 10:19:27] Niv Ucl Builder: we've been thinking about trialing a lottery-like system. the name of everyone who signs up goes inside a random number generator. the person who gets picked suggests the place and time for the social (this can be anything from a museum to the middle of the forest)
[6/12/25, 10:19:43] Niv Ucl Builder: but we're still thinking about the best way to execute this ‎<This message was edited>
[6/12/25, 10:23:13] ~ David L: Sounds like a fun idea to trial! What about today’s session, do we just decide during the meet what to build? Or do you guys continue on what was done from past sessions?
[6/12/25, 10:25:26] Niv Ucl Builder: its a mix of both. some people are working on longer scale projects, other people build something new every session
[6/12/25, 13:27:43] ~ David L: I’m early! Will be at the wasabi

[6/12/25, 20:19:11] Yi Hein: @⁨Ariel KXHL⁩ perhaps one way is to think of markov blankets not as a discrete barrier, but as a continuous causality landscape. where we can draw arbitrary lines of increased causality density. so within any entity, we can draw any recursive number of markov blankets, and each recursive layer has higher and higher causality density. so the higher the causality density, the easier it is to predict the future states of any given entity. idk lol don't understand any of the math behind it
[6/12/25, 20:19:44] Yi Hein: @⁨Haziq KXHL⁩ you seem well versed in FEP, so perhaps could use your insight
[6/12/25, 20:23:03] Haziq KXHL: Oh hiya @⁨Yi Hein⁩ haha i was literally just typing something, gimme a sec
[6/12/25, 20:25:26] Ariel KXHL: Causality density is an interesting concept. I’d think it goes the other way? As in usually as you zoom out more and more, basically when you deal with macro states, these often have stronger causal power. (This is why we model nations as things.) Erik Hoel has some good papers on this if you search “causal emergence”
[6/12/25, 20:25:27] Haziq KXHL: firsly before i start nitpicking @⁨Ariel KXHL⁩ tysm for sharing!! i'm curious how you even got into FEP since it’s a pretty niche topic ngl, now i’m kinda gutted i missed today's session because this would've been interesting to chat about.
[6/12/25, 20:25:34] Ariel KXHL: Also hehehhehehe I sniped you
[6/12/25, 20:25:47] Ariel KXHL: We should talk!
[6/12/25, 20:46:30] Haziq KXHL: personally @⁨Yi Hein⁩ , i wouldn't take the derivation too seriously... when it’s so general, maybe it’s a little too general? like any theory that claims to explain life itself or anything and everything isn’t exactly the most credible from my POV. my field is computational biology and life is messy as hell and we can hardly model even very constrained systems and they break down in like a 1000 different places so yeah, obviously i’m like pls 🙄
[6/12/25, 20:46:51] Haziq KXHL: call it superstition but i’m highly skeptical of top-down approaches that try to explain the mess that is biology from simple unifying principles. i’m pretty much all in on the opposite bottom-up approach of emergence (check out Santa Fe Institute) and in neuroscience i think this really shined in the critical brain hypothesis!! so for me, FEP is only as good as the predictions it makes.
[6/12/25, 20:47:34] Haziq KXHL: now as for FEP applied to cognition (when it’s not trying to explain anything and everything lol), it’s basically taking the old Bayesian brain ideas and turning them into a closed-loop system... the generation/prediction networks are basically stuff from Ullman, Tanenbaum, et al. (2015 and before), but in their version the brain was more passive. Friston though is coupling it to action and calling it "active inference"
[6/12/25, 20:47:50] Haziq KXHL: but i feel this is where some of the existing issues with the Bayesian brain start showing up. this closed-loop framework doesn’t really account for an agent’s motivation or desires, like Laura Schulz pointed out in her debate with Ullman. i think she’s got a solid point when she says that if the brain is building models of the world, the space of possible models is so vast that the only sensible thing to do is constrain it based on the agent’s motivations and goals
[6/12/25, 20:50:56] Haziq KXHL: also artem made a nice video on FEP if anyone's interested

[7/12/25, 09:49:00] Ariel KXHL: I think these two approaches have more in common than you think! I am also a fan of SFI’s work
[7/12/25, 09:51:02] Ariel KXHL: I agree process theories applied to specific complex are super important, but I also think unifying theories are super important 

it would be bad for the entire field to adopt FEP research taste; but it would also be bad if this didn’t exist at all imo

and I think FEP is trying to be what principle of least action is to physics, to biology
[7/12/25, 10:36:43] Haziq KXHL: hmmm yes i’m inclined to agree with you. paul nurse talked about this in an essay - without theory biology research just turns into data dumps. but actually working with the data is pretty sobering and rn a lot of these unifying theories feel like they’re coming from ivory towers. like yeah they’re important, but the problem is when people start putting them on this pedestal that’s above the scrutiny the scientific method demands, which feels more like metaphysics…?

and honestly i’d say FEP is closer to string theory than least action. we still haven’t seen any new testable predictions, just overfitting of existing data and vague “everything makes sense in light of this” claims
[7/12/25, 10:52:04] Haziq KXHL: oh and that whole ‘it’s a principle so it’s not falsifiable’ thing… pls 🙄
Like sure it’s framed as a principle but the moment you need a stack of approximations to actually derive anything, we’re basically in model territory. those are modelling assumptions, not eternal truths.

And once you claim that this model maps onto real-world systems, that’s a scientific hypothesis whether we like it or not. Which means it can be wrong. it should risk being wrong. pretending it somehow floats above falsifiability just feels off
[7/12/25, 11:06:53] Yi Hein: how will we ever know when FEP assumptions hold true? if not we will just be applying it wrongly right, and we can’t trust the worked out results FEP provides. if i have an idea about how the world works, i can technically work backwards to find the right assumptions that will allow derivations that will always make my theory correct
[7/12/25, 11:53:39] Haziq KXHL: We don’t actually need the assumptions to be true… That’s kinda the point of models and theory in science: if the predictions line up with reality, that’s what gives the assumptions their credence. (See popper’s philosophy of science) 
It’s not about the assumptions being sacred truths, it’s about whether the model can be tested and potentially falsified
[7/12/25, 11:55:21] Haziq KXHL: think of it like the Standard Model in particle physics predicting the magnetic moment of the electron to 12 decimal places or Einstein’s theory of gravitation predicting gravitational waves…
Both rely on axioms for which we provide no justification
[7/12/25, 12:17:07] ~ Alp Duygu: this idea of constaining the spce based on the agents motivation is very interesting. I'm not exactly sure if this has been dealt with in neuroscience but theory for similar function has been developed in quantum chemistry.
look up MCTDH and Pruned DVR, both would work fine for this sort of behaviour.
MCTDH expressed the basis in a time dependent form, and lets the basis follow the evolving nuclear wavepacket. This reduces the "attention" given to each and every dimension in a hilbert space(more rigourisly i mean single particle wavefunctions when i say attention). Prune DVR is more crude, it basically removes the basis functions in regions where wavefunction has 0 to very low amplitude.
I hope the parallel is clear

[7/12/25, 13:17:48] Haziq KXHL: 💯🔥
Yesss im definitely more aligned with Kording here and the reply is… meh 😑 
I don’t really get the it’s just a principle rhetoric. ok I don’t have an issue with FEP as long as you don’t tell me that’s how the world works but that’s like exactly what they are doing…!?
[7/12/25, 13:22:53] Haziq KXHL: Bayesian brain was actually promising because they did psychophysical experiments to show that people’s perception actually matches inference with optimal Bayesian priors
[7/12/25, 13:29:05] Haziq KXHL: Hi Alp, so nice to see you here and thx for joining the conversation!!
Very interesting references, will definitely look into it…
Please feel free to introduce yourself, your interests, what you’re learning right now etc. 
I would especially appreciate your recommendations for textbooks on quantum chemistry! And also feel free to suggest a problem set or project related to your field that we (and whoever else is interested) can work on during an upcoming KXHL session
[7/12/25, 14:44:06] Ariel KXHL: I think we do need the assumptions to be true, if by true you mean “apply to the system you’re modeling”. FEP makes certain assumptions about the system its modeling (e.g. constant Markov blanket). If these assumptions don’t hold for the system you’re modeling, you can’t apply FEP. But if the assumptions hold, you can. 

Yes FEP is not opinionated about the particular form of the generative model, (you, as the scientist applying FEP, have to make that choice) but I think the fact that it provides any such framework at all for you to make the choices within is useful. There are plenty of active inference models of autism, psychiatric disorders, etc. that predict the data quite well. A particular application of FEP to some domain, with some specific generative model, can actually be falsified, though FEP itself cannot be (since it’s a theorem that holds if you assume the assumptions it depends on are true)

And the particular assumptions that FEP makes does matter, because those assumptions dictate the scope of the theory; and I think the whole point is that the scope is very large. At its most ambitious it is trying to characterize (formally) what all systems that exist, that is maintain a boundary between themselves and the environment, must do

[7/12/25, 14:45:44] Niv Ucl Builder: i do have a soft spot for those early psychophysical experiments lol. they were so fun
[7/12/25, 15:16:55] Haziq KXHL: the contention is that the assumptions are so abstract and metaphysical in nature that there is really no way to assess whether they apply to a system a priori (but proponents seem to suggest it applies to practically all systems 🤷‍♂️) so all we can do is apply it and see if the predictions are sensible.

r.e. the supposedly successful predictions… like von neumann said to fermi “with four parameters i can fit an elephant and with five i can make him wiggle his trunk” active inference is basically a perfect example of this its like a massively overparameterised model with so many knobs you can retrospectively explain whatever data you want… until someone actually makes a risky prediction something that could have come out wrong but instead was predicted in advance and then verified i just see FEP more as a flexible storytelling / explanatory framework
[7/12/25, 15:31:36] Haziq KXHL: but wait hold on bc my brain just did a backflip… like… what if me denying FEP is literally PROOF that the brain is minimising free energy 😭 like my resistance is just the model defending itself??? hello?? someone unplug me i’m clearly trapped in a recursive epistemic funhouse ☠️ pls i did NOT sign up for this simulation
[7/12/25, 18:07:54] Haziq KXHL: *satire btw 😭
i’m just gonna hide under my markov blanket until someone acknowledges the joke
[7/12/25, 18:08:28] Haziq KXHL: anyway there’s more where that came from…

“Are you active inference?
Because you’re making me take actions I definitely didn’t plan for.”

“You must be Friston’s math,
because I don’t fully understand you but I believe in you.”

If these lines actually work then you’re welcome
[7/12/25, 18:10:51] Yi Hein: @⁨Niv Ucl Builder⁩ could you send the link for the linux user group and the ARC / HPC training at UCL? i need some compute to train my models haha

[7/12/25, 18:23:52] Alex KXHL: myriad seems more cpu focused but there are also gpus asw
[7/12/25, 18:46:00] Ariel KXHL: I think the assumptions are quite specific actually! (1) dp(x)/dt=0, (2) this specific causal graph describes the system well over some timescale and this specific set of states (Markov blanket) delineates the system we’re interested in from the environment are both very specific and not abstract at all. I think the extent of the metaphysics is assuming the world is well-described by stochastic processes, but all of complexity science is (at least) this metaphysical. 

I agree with the von neumann quote and its spirit. There are in fact a lot of knobs, but there are also lots of knobs in modeling intelligent agents as RL agents, for example? I don’t think FEP provides that many more knobs. It is definitely more confusing, but I see this as the fault of whoever is doing the exposition rather than FEP itself. I agree a lot of the empirical work is silly and contrived, but I would not go so far as to say that they retrospectively explain the data. That is terrible scientific practice that will actually get you fired lmao

I do actually agree with the characterization of FEP as a framework, and really this is what I care about way more than specific process theories that try to apply this framework to concrete problems. Because I think on balance there is a lot less work on rigorously and precisely characterizing things that are generally true across biological systems, than work that looks at very specific systems in very specific circumstances. I don’t really care how you’re supposed to make specific modeling choices to predict some specific phenomenon (which is what you do when you’re constructing an active inference model); I’m glad people are working on this, but it’s just not what I find interesting! I think the fields that FEP targets generally lack unification

Anyways sorry for the long paragraph replies I just wanted to reply to you adequately :P
[7/12/25, 19:02:26] Niv Ucl Builder: yeah alex is right, you might be better off with using the cs accounts. to sign up for myriad, you'll need to jump through a lot more hoops (including getting a supervisor to submit an application on your behalf) ‎<This message was edited>

[7/12/25, 19:36:25] Haziq KXHL: nooo pls dont apologize tysm for explaining all that in such detail its honestly a pleasure to chat about this and also pls excuse me for being super disagreeable 😭 im like the youngest in my extended fam so i kinda get away with being annoying ☠️
[7/12/25, 19:37:43] Haziq KXHL: i gotta confess im coming at this super formalist-y rather than platonist-y like if i dont even think real numbers are a thing in real life just a useful tool so its hard for me to buy into the axioms of FEP like they actually describe the world. im mostly an applied scientist so i tend to take a very pragmatic approach to science
[7/12/25, 19:39:20] Haziq KXHL: and as compelling as the idea of a unifying principle is… honestly a lot of these folks havent handled actual living systems. my friend group literally comprises of field ecologists and tumor immunologists who would straight up tell you theres no such thing as a unifying principle in biology 🥲 FEP peeps really need to touch (like actual) grass 😂😭
[7/12/25, 19:39:47] Haziq KXHL: also yes retrospectively explaining data is basically dishonest, tell me about it!! but honestly this is basically the string theorists MO for decades and is exactly the overfitting trap we all know too well
[7/12/25, 19:43:49] Haziq KXHL: finally i find it super interesting that theoreticians are quick to divest from phenomenology and say ‘oops our predictions diverge from reality because people misapplied it’… but as a pragmatist a theory imo is literally a guideline for predicting the real world not some platonic ideal. so when you say the application fields lack unification while FEP was supposed to be the one ring to rule them all… disowning phenomenology kinda defeats the purpose like what’s the actual project here is it just theory for theory’s sake? 🤨
[7/12/25, 19:45:33] Ariel KXHL: Not annoying! This has been interesting so far
[7/12/25, 19:45:58] Ariel KXHL: Gotcha; in case you hadn’t realized my research aesthetics are… the exact opposite, lmao
[7/12/25, 19:46:47] Ariel KXHL: I do want to touch more biological grass! I expect my views won’t change but I could be wrong. But I also wonder how their views would change if they set aside some time to deeply engage with the theory
[7/12/25, 19:48:02] Ariel KXHL: The actual project I care about, which not all people in the field endorse probably, is “how can we formally state what it means for a thing to exist, and what exactly can this formalization tell us?”. So yes kinda theory for theory’s sake, but we are picking some starting point that is relevant irl
[7/12/25, 19:55:12] Haziq KXHL: ahhh but i must warn you ariel they’ll just guilt trip you for doing theoretical work while they’re out here tryna cure cancer and make drugs 😭🤣 

thats how an aspiring humanities major ended up in biosciences (yours truly ofc)
but honestly i have zero doubts theory is invaluable even if the benefit isnt immediately obvious in the short term!!
[7/12/25, 20:00:37] Haziq KXHL: this is actually super cool and ngl you never know… all the great theories of today were once dragged by some annoying little prick (yours truly again 😭☠️) so plot twist you might have the last laugh 👀💀
[7/12/25, 20:08:24] Haziq KXHL: and lol clearly my FEP jokes are very popular so here’s few more 🤭…

[8/12/25, 20:55:14] Haziq KXHL: you just got catfished into a hack lab, welcome in 🤗
[8/12/25, 20:55:49] Haziq KXHL: you scared we’ll hurt a tech bro’s feelings?? they store those in AWS Glacier for long-term cold storage 💀
[8/12/25, 20:56:20] Haziq KXHL: perfect timing, my favourite game is whack-a-VC 🔨
[8/12/25, 20:57:06] Haziq KXHL: wowww i’ve acquired a fanbase already and it’s only monday 🔥
[9/12/25, 02:18:34] Yi Hein: anyone knows how to build hierarchical latent spaces? so like going up in the hierarchy you get more and more generalisation of concepts, and more abstract. and via some distance measure. a concrete concept will have a short distance value to all related abstract concepts. and abstract concept will also have a short distance to similar abstract concepts.

might argue that divergent thinking is: concrete -> abstract -> abstract -> concrete transformation

humans can do this easily and searching through hundred of thousands of hours of experience easily in abstract and concrete spaces.

i just need to solve the engineering challenge of abstract semantic search without context-length constraints. for 150 million research articles and find out subsets of articles grouped by an abstract concept (can be cross disciplinary). current SOTA RAG systems using embedding similarity are too crappy.
[9/12/25, 02:21:50] Yi Hein: i feel like maybe a preliminary plan might be to stack up VAEs and then do contrastive learning, and using context-limited LLMs to generate the ground truth (positive and negative examples)? not sure if anyone has other ideas ‎<This message was edited>
[9/12/25, 02:24:38] Samuel KXHL: There might be some fun stuff you can do with SAEs eg. https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01197 if you want to generate concepts in an unsupervised way
[9/12/25, 02:27:47] Yi Hein: nice, thanks just what i was looking for, would have a read
[9/12/25, 02:32:36] Yi Hein: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.06033
[9/12/25, 02:32:46] Yi Hein: found another interesting paper
[9/12/25, 02:33:38] Yi Hein: nice that one of the authors is a UCL lecturer too
‎[9/12/25, 02:47:20] Yi Hein: I think there are some interesting ideas here. So the Poincaré encoder allows us to have short distance transversals going up and down a tree, but have long distance between two 'concrete' nodes.

but if we augment the this distance metric with the distance of token embeddings in euclidean space, we can get the best of both worlds ‎image omitted
‎[9/12/25, 03:02:32] Yi Hein: this seems very buildable actually, there is a github repo too. and almost exactly what i was looking for. Sounds like the perfect side quest. And it’s exciting to see how well it will work scaling this up with more params and larger datasets (all research articles) ‎image omitted
‎[9/12/25, 03:06:36] Yi Hein: So next step is to build hierarchical SAEs in a poincare disc ‎image omitted
[9/12/25, 08:09:42] Haziq KXHL: yi hein casually dropping riemannian geometry at 3am… newcomers thinking they joined the wrong gc 🤭
dont worry folks we’re definitely a normal hack club… except for the nights we start fighting cats and dogs over friston’s fep lol
[9/12/25, 08:10:40] Haziq KXHL: poincaré ball is very pretty but it forces deeper nodes closer and closer to the boundary. with small hierarchies that’s fine but once you scale to millions of leaf nodes everything just collapses to like 0.999999999 radius. at that point floating point numbers literally can’t represent meaningful differences anymore so the geometry breaks down numerically even though it’s still right in theory. we use it in single cell stuff and it works great on the order of 10^5 cells but maybe not so great for embedding half of arxiv plus grandma’s cooking blog
[9/12/25, 08:12:21] Haziq KXHL: but the poincaré disk is just one way of representing hyperbolic geometry. the lorentz model gives you the same geometry without the boundary singularity and is so much more stable at scale
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03417
[9/12/25, 08:23:16] Haziq KXHL: bro not to be a buzzkill but it’s unlikely you’re gonna beat SOTA by just putting two and two together. the people who come up with this stuff are very capable of that already and LLMs are on literally everyone’s radar right now. the era of low-hanging fruit in AI is kinda over so the real gains come from actually engaging with the theory and pushing the math forward
[9/12/25, 08:36:33] Haziq KXHL: omg this convo is taking me to when I was in love with geometry 😢 istg I wanted to do everything except bio but now im just a disgruntled biologist with a heart full of unfulfilled academic romances. I still have this book tho

[9/12/25, 09:07:01] ~ MS: This stuff sounds really cool but I don't get what any of it means
[9/12/25, 09:07:27] ~ MS: Is there anything I can search up to get the gist?

[9/12/25, 11:23:27] Haziq KXHL: why is everyone airing bro here?? welcome to the club! 0% of us have any clue either, 100% of us are here anyway 🤗
[9/12/25, 11:26:26] ~ Lubna Kharusi: Me neither 😅
[9/12/25, 11:31:33] Haziq KXHL: look up geometric deep learning à la Michael Bronstein for a discussion on imposing geometric/topological priors in deep learning...

tl;dr language has this kinda hierarchy from abstract to concrete concepts. ever played 20 questions? ‘is it living?’, ‘is it real?’ are abstract, while ‘dog’, ‘labrador’, etc are concrete.

if we make our language models use that kinda structure, they’ll perform so much better… vanilla deep nets just don’t know any of this, so we’re basically sneaking in our insights about how language is structured
[9/12/25, 11:37:57] Haziq KXHL: maybe it would help if you tell us your field of study?
these ideas have also been discussed in cognitive neuroscience

[9/12/25, 14:33:42] ~ Xi2???: altho i wonder if the culture of independent / proactive undergrad led research should be more prominent in the uk
[9/12/25, 14:37:04] Yi Hein: Yeah I think this is really important
[9/12/25, 14:37:30] Yi Hein: But more easy to do in computational fields

[9/12/25, 14:39:20] ~ Xi2???: https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/crosscoders/index.html
maybe modifying this to be hierarchical could be interesting?
[9/12/25, 14:39:30] ~ Xi2???: fixes some of the issues w SAEs
[9/12/25, 14:40:21] Yi Hein: Woah amazing stuff!
[9/12/25, 14:41:23] ~ Xi2???: this in particular has some super interesting stuff where they can track features that rotate in latent space across layers so u can keep track of the same features despite transformations which might have cool geometric interpretations?
[9/12/25, 14:43:21] Haziq KXHL: It’s already the case in places like imperial (my sister published in Cell when she was 19 ☠️) but it comes at a huge cost in terms of mental health which I dont think is worth it…
But if students are genuinely passionate about research in a healthy way then universities should provide opportunities, my prof’s at UCL haven’t been receptive at all which is really annoying 🤬

[9/12/25, 15:02:06] Yi Hein: just keep trying man, i think there is an element of fomo on their end because they probably wasn’t doing research from 1st year

@⁨Ariel KXHL⁩ @⁨~Xi2???⁩ ngl I actually love predictive coding a la Rao & Ballard. I just don’t think deriving predictive coding from FEP really adds anything. We’re always looking for the most minimal theory that explains the evidence... like both GR and kaluza-klein explain gravitation but the latter introduces an extra dimension wihtout accounting for any new data (given that the applications are primarily neuro). FEP feels like that... more machinery, but not necessarily more explanatory power
[10/12/25, 08:38:57] Niv Ucl Builder: ill actually come to the defense of FEP here (🤕😮)
[10/12/25, 08:42:11] Niv Ucl Builder: i think FEP requires a lot more machinery only because it offers a wider framework than PC (which is really only a theory about how cortical circuits might work)
[10/12/25, 08:44:18] Niv Ucl Builder: i recall arial telling me how the FEP can also be applied to non-human stuff stuff like bacteria and pendulums (i still thinj the pendulum is just the author taking the piss and FEP people havent realized it yet)
[10/12/25, 08:45:46] Haziq KXHL: Et tu Nivyan??
[10/12/25, 08:47:26] Haziq KXHL: yes supposedly... but they are yet to provide any actual/defensible data that it fits in non-neuro context
[10/12/25, 08:48:07] Haziq KXHL: and let me remind you that it is literally people who've never seen a bacterium under a microscope making these claims 🤭
[10/12/25, 08:48:28] Niv Ucl Builder: nonetheless, FEP theory is quite a bit more complicated because it claims to do a lot more. it tries to explain why as well as how (pc only explains one of these). similarly, pc also presupposes a lot more stuff compared to FEP (system boundaries, the existence of an agent trying to model the object, etc)
[10/12/25, 08:49:19] Niv Ucl Builder: nooo, im not sold on FEP
[10/12/25, 08:49:21] Niv Ucl Builder: but
[10/12/25, 08:49:32] Niv Ucl Builder: i think its interesting that it exists
[10/12/25, 08:50:17] Niv Ucl Builder: i mean i think fep-ers do have a lot of papers on these
[10/12/25, 08:51:07] Niv Ucl Builder: its just up to whether you believe that the data fits the model or whether they make the model fit the data
[10/12/25, 08:51:10] Niv Ucl Builder: that is all
[10/12/25, 08:51:12] Haziq KXHL: yes im also glad it exists... bickering about FEP might just be my fave hobby 😁
[10/12/25, 08:51:44] Niv Ucl Builder: i think everyone should be allowed to propose theories!
[10/12/25, 08:51:58] Niv Ucl Builder: #equality
[10/12/25, 08:54:39] Haziq KXHL: we're gonna do a neuroanatomy quiz in KXHL one day and all the FEP folks will magically disappear 😆 they will have to update their priors elsewhere
[10/12/25, 08:56:11] Niv Ucl Builder: if youre an astronomer, name 20 planets 😭
[10/12/25, 08:57:31] Haziq KXHL: phew good thing I'm not 😭
[10/12/25, 08:58:23] Niv Ucl Builder: though im sure friston would run laps around everyone in this group and their PIs if we were to challenge him to such ‎<This message was edited>
[10/12/25, 08:59:10] Niv Ucl Builder: but its fine because like half of the fep people disagree with him too
[10/12/25, 08:59:37] Haziq KXHL: i mean dont get me wrong, guy is an absolute legend, single most influential neuroscientist ever!!
[10/12/25, 09:06:22] Haziq KXHL: question for you @⁨Yi Hein⁩ , since you said you want to achieve AGI by mimicking the brain… credit assignment is one of the clearest examples of how orthogonal a lot of deep learning research is to computational neuroscience. backprop just Does Not make sense biologically so yes predictive coding style learning rules are a step toward biological plausibility but deep nets have even MORE fundamental issues

like for example,,, the multilayer perceptron literally assumes each “neuron” has a continuous activation value?? what is that supposed to be biologically?? rate coding?? be serious pls. a neuron maxes out at like 500 Hz, so if u wanna represent 500+ discrete activation levels u need over a whole second to accumulate that precision,,, meanwhile an entire visual forward pass (RGC -> LGN -> V1 -> V2 -> V4 -> IT) happens in like 50-100ms??? hello???

make it make sense pls
[10/12/25, 09:07:07] Haziq KXHL: im not saying the brain cant compute complicated stuff, im saying it is VERY clearly not using an MLP type architecture. MLPs dont capture population coding at all and population coding CAN represent high dimensional continuous info efficiently which lines up way better with the whole neural manifold perspective
[10/12/25, 09:12:33] Haziq KXHL: anyways that’s why i don’t think deep learning should be the focus if we actually care about understanding the brain or helping patients… unless the endgame is just building SOTA ai girlfriends in which case i guess that’s a “research direction” too 🤷‍♂️
(gosh i hate the ai industrial-complex, represents the absolute worst of late stage capitalism)
[10/12/25, 12:27:04] Yi Hein: yeah the underlying mechanism of the brain and ML models are vastly different. there was a study that showed that a singular neuron requires a DNN to approximate it. what i am interested in is more into cognitive science and observations of things that humans can do that current ML models can’t. and finding tricks to make that happen in ML models. these are likely emergent properties which can arise from multiple underlying implementations, so i’m not too focused on ‘biological plausibility’. an example of this is reasoning models, which tries exploit to usefulness of talking through a problem/thinking process.

for example, the hierarchical latent space stuff is from the frustration of the limitations of embeedings for RAG, in which humans don’t encounter. we can reason in a very divergent manner, linking abstract concepts together etc, so the question is whether we can give ML models that ability too
[10/12/25, 12:32:03] Samuel KXHL: Yeah I think that unless we have changes in hardware, optimal learning algorithms implemented on GPUs probably look pretty different from optimal learning algorithms within brains
[10/12/25, 12:34:58] Yi Hein: yeah alsos biological systems exploit a lot of the ‘free computation’ provided by chemistry/physics  provided by the natural world. if we want to simulate fluids movement, protein-protein interactions, that’s gonna be really expensive on GPU, but that’s free in the real world
[10/12/25, 12:36:51] Yi Hein: retinal waves have always been fascinating to me, like how do you even train a vision model with 0 data
[10/12/25, 12:42:43] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Exactly! LLMs still don’t really mimic how we think - it only recreates the function of reasoning because the text requires it when chained to a CoT process
[10/12/25, 12:43:05] ~ Arhaan: The logo looks pretty cool
[10/12/25, 12:44:10] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: It’s not just hardware the process is completely different. I think it was the GPT-4 paper, they showed as we increase compute and parameters yes we reduce loss but the synthesis is different
[10/12/25, 12:45:27] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Something I’m trying to figure out lately is can it synthesise something new from patterns of knowledge we haven’t seen before or will it always be limited to synthesising within what we have trained it on? Thoughts, anyone?
[10/12/25, 12:46:15] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Like the whole genius hits the targets no one can see is people like that can synthesise from knowledge that hasn’t been put together yet
[10/12/25, 12:46:44] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Can LLMs do it yet (no?) but will we get there as a mathematical plausibility?
[10/12/25, 13:10:53] Haziq KXHL: okkk that’s actually fair… population codes or deep net hidden layers… all are ultimately trying to learning a meaningful representation of data

r.e. talking (internal monologue) through a problem… Spelke has done some really beautiful work on this!

ooo and linking concepts the way the hippocampus does… now doesn’t that sound like the Tolman-eichenbaum machine?
[10/12/25, 13:19:00] Haziq KXHL: I will let the AI connoisseurs take this question… too busy being a proud ai hater to contribute meaningfully
[10/12/25, 13:32:12] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Well you could share the counterfactual
[10/12/25, 17:41:40] Haziq KXHL: @⁨Ariel KXHL⁩ was going through your FEP derivation on Notion (because who doesn't love a math-induced aneurysm between lectures) and ngl the math is not mathing... 😬

especially the “generalisation of Helmholtz decomposition” part... that bit is super sus. Helmholtz is way more general than the form you provide so what you actually have there is an unjustified restriction not a generalisation

Like… you can’t just gaslight Helmholtz into giving you the ∇ln p term. there are infinitely many drift fields f(x) that satisfy your steady-state condition. you picked the one special-case solution that happens to support an FEP interpretation and then treated it as if it were the general form 😑
[10/12/25, 17:44:49] Haziq KXHL: i didn’t mean i think they’re technically limited or that there’s a better approach etc. 
i just personally don’t find them interesting so others are better positioned to answer this
[10/12/25, 18:22:51] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Makes sense. Curious - wdym better approaches?
[10/12/25, 18:30:00] Haziq KXHL: oops sorry for the unclear wording, not trying to imply there is a better approach. just impartial to the whole llm debate because i personally dont feel building better and better llm's are a worthy pursuit 🤷‍♂️ (yesss i am opinionated biologist...)
[10/12/25, 18:31:11] Haziq KXHL: oh my gosh i’m so sorry everyone 😭 idk what’s wrong with me today, i’ve been picking fights with literally everyone for no reason…
i promise i’m actually really nice in person
@⁨Yi Hein⁩ @⁨Niv Ucl Builder⁩ @⁨~samia 💗🌸⁩ pls confirm 🙏😢
[10/12/25, 18:32:56] Haziq KXHL: *im actually known for my sweet disposition... so sweet the World Diabetes Foundation had to issue a warning 🤭
[10/12/25, 18:38:58] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Wait no haha not fight since I joined the chat recently I need… more ‘context’ pun not intended
[10/12/25, 18:39:16] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Like what are you pro-XXX in this dynamic?
[10/12/25, 18:39:24] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Cuz clearly the whole world is betting on this
[10/12/25, 18:39:43] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: (Also very impressive man how you understand math and all!!!)
[10/12/25, 19:14:52] Haziq KXHL: no no they’re definitely gonna ban me from KXHL any second istg 😭 they’re not even confirming my nice guy status
[10/12/25, 19:28:15] Haziq KXHL: ooooo good question…
i’m pro-science-that-actually-solves-real-problems. things like food insecurity, infectious disease... stuff that affects the majority, not just whatever’s trendy in VC-land
im pro publicly funded research that isn’t shaped by corporate incentives. personally my focus is health equity.

it’s 2025 and a Black patient still has a higher mortality rate than a white patient with the same pathology. women still die more than men from the same diseases. meanwhile corporations are pouring billions into anti-aging tech so billionaires can try to live to 200.

they build therapies for the people who can pay instead of making therapies people can actually afford
[10/12/25, 19:34:15] ~ Suhas: Do you not think LLMs will be able to accelerate scientific research in these areas?
[10/12/25, 19:36:52] Haziq KXHL: oh it absolutely does. AI research is important and genuinely valuable. it gave us AlphaFold, Evo2, huge jumps in quantum chemistry and drug design. I’m not anti-AI as a scientific tool.

my hatred is specifically toward the AI industrial complex (see Empire of AI by Karen Hao). the corporate ecosystem built around hype, extraction, and profit at the expense of public good is the part I’m criticizing, not the underlying science.
[10/12/25, 19:38:00] ~ Suhas: That was the book that overstated AI water usage by 1000x right?
[10/12/25, 19:38:41] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: While I agree that you need to deploy it for more public good isn’t how we democratise tech is by doing what is trendy so it unlocks economies of scale?
[10/12/25, 19:39:11] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Like NVIDIA chips were popularised thru gaming - a pursuit that has little or no public benefit
[10/12/25, 19:39:16] Haziq KXHL: ugh yes that part was definitely off but the point still stands. the broader critique of the AI industrial ecosystem is still very real
[10/12/25, 19:39:35] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: But now that is it built there are so many applicatiosn for the chips. That is how technology always eventually benefit the world right?
[10/12/25, 19:39:58] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Like moon landing itself was probably a fancy project but the research and economic benefit was 13x what was spent on it (quiting Brian Cox)
[10/12/25, 19:40:01] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: *quoting
[10/12/25, 19:40:38] ~ Suhas: If your claim can be off by a factor of 1000 and still be broadly true then I'm not sure whether the claim is specific enough to have meaningful truth value
[10/12/25, 19:41:01] ~ Suhas: Not that I disagree massively with the place the critique is coming from ‎<This message was edited>
[10/12/25, 19:42:14] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: No beef with anyone but I love the way you worded this haha
[10/12/25, 19:43:27] Haziq KXHL: you’re basically describing effective altruism or Adam Smith’s “invisible hand” logic, where you restructure incentives so that people acting from self-interest accidentally produce a more egalitarian outcome.

I reject that premise. I’m actually more optimistic than that. I think people are fundamentally good and should be willing to sacrifice their own incentives for the collective benefit. I don’t think greed has to be the mechanism through which we achieve a just society
[10/12/25, 19:45:07] Haziq KXHL: haha fair fair. if you want a more academic and defensible version of that critique defo see Atlas of AI by Kate Crawford. she makes the same arguments but with way tighter empirics
[10/12/25, 19:46:04] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: I liked the chat when it was technical (so I could learn more - these have relatively established ‘definitive’ answers I have had at important events haha - Google me;)) so not going to continue this convo but I am going to leave with Bezos’ quote: *he became $100B rich but Amazon is $1.1T so he made other people (mostly pension funds?) 10x richer!*
[10/12/25, 19:46:37] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Back to tech people! Let’s build 😉
[10/12/25, 19:50:42] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: (But of course happy to share thoughts on DM if you are interested :))
[10/12/25, 19:50:52] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Cuz team game haha!
[10/12/25, 19:52:26] Haziq KXHL: no no this is not the type of GC or club where we compartmentalise anything. we debate politics, philosophy, math and neuroscience all in the same five-minute window
[10/12/25, 19:52:46] Haziq KXHL: Bezos quote is cute but it also contains this in small print: (warehouse injury rates, union-busting, worker surveillance, heat-stress fatalities investigations, algorithmic firing, the FTC antitrust suit, environmental violations)
[10/12/25, 19:53:05] Haziq KXHL: yeah let’s build… more systems that replicate the exact same inequalities we just pretended not to see 👍
[10/12/25, 19:53:20] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Wait no if gc is okay with it I am down
[10/12/25, 19:53:29] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: I felt like its a very tech one so felt offtopic
[10/12/25, 19:53:37] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: you sure this is not offtopic?
[10/12/25, 19:54:12] Haziq KXHL: i promise you, this is how we spend 50% of our in-person hack sessions anyways 😆
[10/12/25, 19:54:45] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Ohh nice game on!
[10/12/25, 19:55:43] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: While I agree Bezos could have done it more humanly the premise stands that it is a lot easier to innovate in self-interest and distribute than otherwise
[10/12/25, 19:55:58] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: humanely*
‎[10/12/25, 19:56:26] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: ‎image omitted
[10/12/25, 19:56:41] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Capitalism babe!
[10/12/25, 19:57:20] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: (Again I understand it could have been done in more humane ways!)
[10/12/25, 19:58:17] Haziq KXHL: politically I’m hyper-progressive (Žižek / Zohran Mamdani energy) and very much the cursed last child of parents who were deep into grassroots activism and charity work. a lot of scientists and technologists just don’t have that perspective.

when you grow up close to real human suffering, you learn fast what actually matters and what’s just tech-world noise.

that’s the place it’s coming from.
[10/12/25, 20:00:14] ~ Suhas: Ah I see. I think I do actually disagree with the place the critique is coming from then.
[10/12/25, 20:01:05] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: I think the first principles question we need to answer is as a species are we in the point to slow down enjoy the benefits of what we have innovated or do we still need to keep pushing?
and b) is it realistic to ever achieve there cuz bad actors will keep innovating?
[10/12/25, 20:01:25] Haziq KXHL: yes, that graph does show Adam Smith was right. the invisible hand works, capitalism scales, and the net effect has been positive globally. I’m not denying that.

I just think we should expect better from humanity. the underlying premise that greed is the most reliable engine of progress is something I really struggle with. even if the net effect is positive, the collateral damage and human suffering built into that mechanism is not something I can just treat as an acceptable cost.

so it’s not “capitalism doesn’t work,” it’s “it works, but at a moral price we shouldn’t be so quick to accept.”
[10/12/25, 20:03:29] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Then the question is are we really reducing human suffering or we are just redistributing human suffering including suffering we believe that could have prevented but we just don’t know yet (i.e. do we stop innovation now so healthcare stops and life expectancy stays here so do we push it. And how arbitarary it is to say its 75 and not 55 or 95?)
[10/12/25, 20:03:52] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: You gotta admit this is fun! 😝
[10/12/25, 20:05:38] Haziq KXHL: well the point is not to stop innovation at all. I’m literally a scientist in training. innovation is the entire project.

the point is being willing to take a pay cut to work on problems we are structurally de-incentivised to work on. think malaria instead of longevity research, antibiotic resistance instead of building nicer recommendation engines.

innovation isn’t the issue. it’s what we choose to innovate towards
[10/12/25, 20:07:12] Haziq KXHL: yeah ngl I live for this. thanks for humoring me 😁
[10/12/25, 20:09:03] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: I can see
[10/12/25, 20:09:19] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Walking will reply shortly
[10/12/25, 20:25:40] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: We are backkk
[10/12/25, 20:26:17] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: and actually i am glad i had the pause - so what you are saying is a personal perspective than any structural arguments (which id expect a response to above two texts on first principle-taught questions)
[10/12/25, 20:26:59] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: And that yeah - because point of capitalism broadly is people are greedy and it harnesses that. IF your personal perspective is more altruistic then it still fits into capitlaism and its your pov
[10/12/25, 20:27:31] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: (But that said as life happens - when you are so smart world warps around you early on but life happens later and bills get real and competition gets more multifacated you might change your opinions)
[10/12/25, 20:28:16] Haziq KXHL: yes precisely… im not trying to preach any ideology or politics, im simply trying to explain why im a lil bit insufferable and opinionated for which you must excuse me 🙏
[10/12/25, 20:30:26] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: One might argue that is a nice way to evade responsibility for your opinions 😝
[10/12/25, 20:32:03] Haziq KXHL: sure but really its opinions about how i want to live life rather than how people should behave or society should work so i think i get a free pass
[10/12/25, 20:33:25] Haziq KXHL: I never really discuss this stuff anyways… unless someone specifically asks about my worldview
[10/12/25, 20:34:49] Haziq KXHL: *at least one person describes me as nice 🥳 yay
‎[10/12/25, 20:37:27] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Hahaha ‎image omitted
[10/12/25, 20:46:16] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Btw for the record you are awesome okay? Crazy intellect man! - personally motivated me to further deep dive into tech (actively working on this!)!
[10/12/25, 20:46:42] Haziq KXHL: yeah that’s a fair concern tbf… public-sector research pay is painfully real (ex-GOSH intern hello 😭), but it kinda just depends on what “bills” means to you. for some people it’s mortgages on three houses and two sports cars. for others it’s a dingy flat and a 2008 fiat punto that builds character. i’m definitely the latter and honestly way past the point of return 😅

if there’s “competition” for underpaid, unsexy research work then i’d actually welcome it lol. could really use more colleagues in women’s health research, we’re severely understaffed rn
[10/12/25, 20:47:06] Haziq KXHL: Thanks so much bro, really appreciate it!!
[10/12/25, 20:48:48] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: It’s hard for me to synthesise an experience for you but it goes along the lines would you really work in a lab for public research when your friends make millions in quant finance? Add later it is not just you - are you really okay sending your kids to public school (less graphic example but you get the idea) cuz you choose morality over money? ‎<This message was edited>
[10/12/25, 20:48:54] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: You don’t need to answer that haha
[10/12/25, 20:51:29] Haziq KXHL: honestly you guys are fantastic too!! we progressives have this terrible habit of making anyone who’s not in our camp look like the Big Bad Wolf and that’s soooo wrong 😭 i apologise on behalf of our movement lollll
[10/12/25, 20:56:11] Haziq KXHL: oh no pls i get this all the time 😭 like genuinely… this kind of trajectory does come with a cost. it means i can do less for the people i care about, and i’m very aware of that. but i’m lucky to be surrounded by people who actually value this path over any financial/material upside i could’ve offered.

and who said anything about kids lol?? i’m not about to bring someone into the world just to make them face the consequences of my life choices 💀
[10/12/25, 21:01:28] Haziq KXHL: but i should probably warn you that i have another inflammatory opinion in this area (as if you guys haven’t suffered enough already lol):
i honestly don’t think wanting biological children is justifiable when there are so many kids in orphanages and foster care. children enrich your life whether or not they share your DNA and i kinda think it’s a bit conceited for people to assume they’re so great that they need to be genetically replicated 😅
[10/12/25, 21:06:53] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Wellll if you are aware of the costs and still cool with it, all good but from all I’ve seen so far people change. Also I’ve a friend at UEA studying math she and you would vibe so well man!
[10/12/25, 21:10:27] Haziq KXHL: r.e. underpaid lab work while my friends make millions in quant…
honestly yes 😭 and i must confess i’m an ex-aspiring humanities kid who got indoctrinated by one too many tragic Greek and Victorian stories

but also let’s be real, I get some pretty major upsides: never becoming a banal LinkedIn-coded corporate clone, no risk of saying “circle back” or “per my last email” unironically, etc. 😆🤭

and i get to live the most nonchalant, irresponsible life while being completely self-righteous about it 😌
[10/12/25, 21:11:14] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Also quick counterfactual - what if you made millions first and use that to fund your public research?
[10/12/25, 21:11:16] Haziq KXHL: pls do add her to the chat!! right now, im severely outnumbered by the VC/PE folks in the GC
[10/12/25, 21:11:51] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Ofc. I’ll ask if she’s interested :) 
What should be the pitch? Send me a 1-2 line intro
[10/12/25, 21:12:24] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Adding this because it also feels like loads of people choose morality because they can’t play the multifaceted game (your evasive thoughts on LinkedIn promoted this)
[10/12/25, 21:13:08] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Like what you’re saying is one dimensional and you don’t need to pick up any other skills to do life which brings back to the point when you’re smart world warps around you at start but …
[10/12/25, 21:13:08] Haziq KXHL: thats what they all say, never happens IRL
i say tax the millionaires and give us the money for research... classic Žižek/Mamdani argument
[10/12/25, 21:13:30] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: No I meant your personal take not as a model
[10/12/25, 21:14:06] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Model is capitalism that you didn’t make a valid argument why not. Your personal take was my question why don’t you make millions first and then fund 2x what public funds give
[10/12/25, 21:15:05] Haziq KXHL: personally... (1) wasted research time (2) not something i would enjoy pursuing or even capable of doing, im not built for making millions - i dont have that acumen/attitude ‎<This message was edited>
[10/12/25, 21:18:46] ~ Suhas: I'd say Moskovitz and Gates did alright as a start
[10/12/25, 21:19:39] ~ Suhas: and realistically if it's taxed that money is all going to welfare and pensions rather than research but that's not a serious argument from me ‎<This message was edited>
[10/12/25, 21:19:47] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: There you go! So it’s not morality driven 😂😂
[10/12/25, 21:19:57] Haziq KXHL: the idea that people choose morality because they are bad at LinkedIn lolll
for me it is actually the opposite though. the path you are referring to is the one people have been following for millennia: school, job, marriage, kids. it is the classic default storyline. if I wanted a one-dimensional life I would just pick that. it is literally the most socially validated and most optimised route humans have ever produced.
[10/12/25, 21:19:58] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Right?!
[10/12/25, 21:20:12] ~ Suhas: Maybe we can get a wealth tax for a quadruple lock
[10/12/25, 21:21:23] Haziq KXHL: yes of course, my morality is severely constrained by my capabilities loll
[10/12/25, 21:22:09] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: There you go…
[10/12/25, 21:22:29] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: And now we can argue whether if at all it was morality driven or just a PR sticker for those constrains
[10/12/25, 21:22:47] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Btw god the only reason I am engaging in this is cuz you said okay. You don’t hate me right?
[10/12/25, 21:23:02] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Like it’s not a personal attack - as intellectual adults we good? 😂❤️
[10/12/25, 21:23:51] Haziq KXHL: brooo never!! these are all very valid questions and im totally deserving of all this roasting cos ive been tormenting this GC for way too long so everyone's literally clapping for you in the background 😆🤣
[10/12/25, 21:23:57] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: And I also hope it gives you some content to reflect on and see if your current strategy is the best or if you can gain minor skill advantages you might have asymmetric returns for your game 😊
[10/12/25, 21:24:32] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Like if learning LinkedIn game means you get millions to fund a cause it’s worth it right - just an anecdotal example
[10/12/25, 21:24:43] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: For you to reflect later - and in good faith
[10/12/25, 21:24:53] Haziq KXHL: honestly that is a fair philosophical question 😭 like is it morality or is it just me putting a cute ethical sticker over my own limitations. probably a messy blend of both tbh. humans are extremely talented at moralising whatever they were going to do anyway lol
[10/12/25, 21:25:28] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: I love your honesty! You’ll genuinely do well in life with that attitude 👏
[10/12/25, 21:26:01] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Alright man back to tech? I could learn something in that 😂
[10/12/25, 21:26:29] Haziq KXHL: ofc bro, always happy to talk tech!!
[10/12/25, 21:27:24] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Well as a when it comes haha. Some context. These days I took up three agentic AI projects and learning how to do these while practicing for data science coding interviews
[10/12/25, 21:27:55] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Figured I am not senior enough to deploy earlier said skills at work yet the hard way haha 😂
[10/12/25, 21:29:36] Ariel KXHL: Hi, good catch! I likely won’t respond to more stuff like this over whatsapp because your messages keep getting buried and I’m annoyed I have to keep scrolling up lmao. Email me or something if you have specific technical questions

Yes agree Helmholtz is way more general, but it’s actually an iff. As in, f(x) = (Gamma - Q) blah blah… <=> dp/dt = 0. The core of the proof is you note that dp/dt = 0 <=> divergence [ blah ] = 0 implies blah is divergence free, where blah is the relevant stuff in Fokker Planck. This is equivalent to saying blah is rewritable as Q nabla_x p(x), where Q is antisymmetric. And then you just rearrange some stuff, substitute in def of ln p(x) and you get the equivalence

If you actually want the details on the Helmholtz generalization you can dig through this somewhat impenetrable text https://nemenmanlab.org/~ilya/images/5/5e/Ao,_2004.pdf
[10/12/25, 21:30:34] Ariel KXHL: I really should put this in at some point but I’m way too lazy - going to do a complete rewrite that covers all the derivations soon 😛
[10/12/25, 21:31:11] Haziq KXHL: arent we all? 🤭 but tysm for clarifying, ill defo check that out!!
[10/12/25, 21:33:42] Ariel KXHL: Have fun
[10/12/25, 21:50:25] Haziq KXHL: "KXHL: the only GC where you can discuss GPUs, Žižek, bioethics and quant finance within five minutes. we promise it’s fun 🤥"

[11/12/25, 22:26:30] Yi Hein: Search up in-context learning
[11/12/25, 22:27:47] Yi Hein: Give the model a novel task, with examples in the context, and it can solve it using abstract concepts learnt from training data

[12/12/25, 02:45:47] ~ Arhaan: Quanta Magazine is goated
[12/12/25, 02:47:00] Haziq KXHL: I love hyper dimensional computing cos they actually try to capture population coding which is how the biological brain represents information
[12/12/25, 02:49:45] Haziq KXHL: Also synthesising new patterns of knowledge we haven’t seen before sounds an awful lot like hallucination ngl 😆

[12/12/25, 12:09:46] Haziq KXHL: Retinal waves are acc so cracked ngl
Tl;dr pretraining ConvNet via hebbian learning with this type of stimuli gives more separable representations for MNIST classification…
But this is not necessarily the optimal stimuli for pre training. What I’d like to see is an RL agent that generates retinal wave like stimuli, with reward function being linear separability of hidden representations when you pass in actual data ☠️

They asked if I was busy and I said yes obviously 🙄…
they were like ‘aren’t you the socialist who doesn’t believe in effective altruism?’
Next thing I know they’re assigning me to the stall like ‘come on sweetheart, put those principles to work’

[14/12/25, 01:07:19] Haziq KXHL: as a physical chemistry student, i’d like to propose an additional model:
quantum situationship
do not observe unless prepared for emotional collapse
[14/12/25, 01:12:31] ~ Alp Duygu: how about situationship entaglement for the ones who love the chase...if the state of the other party is love then the player immediately changes their state to uninterested
[14/12/25, 01:19:13] Haziq KXHL: note from the neurogeometry side: given place cell representations are topologically equivalent to a torus, one must ask what structure love circuits inhabit
my hypothesis: the klein bottle = non-orientable, self-intersecting and every attempt to define boundaries ends badly
[14/12/25, 01:21:30] Haziq KXHL: once again our resident physical chemistry professor delivers unparalleled theoretical insight
[14/12/25, 01:28:03] ~ Alp Duygu: sorry for the late reply, 
Im Alp, im 1st year studying Chemistry with maths, i am interested in theoretical chemistry. I have spent some time learning quantum mechanics and am now interested in chemical/biochemical phenomena that can be explained with qm. I am currently learning about the CISS effect, which challenges the famous idea that chirality does not change the properties of a molecule. I am also always down for some philosophy talk, im mostly interested in epistemology, philosophy of science/maths/language and logic.
I have been a pen and paper person thus far so im not exactly a hacker, however i am trying to learn some computing so any advice is appreciated.
When it comes to textbooks,
i quite liked intro to QM by Sengupta and Pal, and ofc atkins molecular quantum mechanics.
When it comes to the problem set, i just have one which is the exact solution of the molecular hamiltonian....
[14/12/25, 01:31:06] ~ Alp Duygu: this is the scientific reduction we needed!
[14/12/25, 02:31:41] Haziq KXHL: welcome Alp!! this is fantastic, thanks so much for the introduction 😊

also just to say, hack club is really a bit of a misnomer: it’s much more a forum for totally unfiltered and unwarranted discussions, and for people who don’t really separate STEM from life, day from night, or healthy caffeine intake from overdose

the areas you’re working on are absolutely fascinating, especially the qm-bio interface and the CISS effect, so we’re verrrry happy to have you here and hope to see you (eventually!) in one of our future sessions

really glad you joined!!
[14/12/25, 02:32:14] Haziq KXHL: also, i came across a book you might enjoy: Quantum Chemistry and Computing for the Curious by Sharkey & Chancé. the whole premise reminded me of what you mentioned about approximate computational solutions of the schrödinger equation often being far more powerful (and honest) than analytic approximations with their thousand corrections and caveats
[15/12/25, 13:46:25] Yi Hein: Hi everyone, just a reminder that our next session is *wednesday* at 5.30pm at Kings Cross, followed by a social at 7pm.

[16/12/25, 15:18:48] Haziq KXHL: Hi team, just circling back to re-surface and drive alignment ahead of Wednesday.

As a quick level-set, we’re looking to sanity-check attendance to enable proactive capacity planning, optimise on-site resource allocation, and ensure stakeholder expectations are appropriately managed.

Would appreciate visibility on who is planning to attend so we can close the loop and move forward in a coordinated way.

Thanks all, keen to keep momentum here.

[17/12/25, 15:21:54] Haziq KXHL: samiaaa do you charge consulting fees for reassuring sick people or is this pro bono under your CSR duties 😌💼
bc this is the most emotionally repressed reassurance ever lol
[17/12/25, 15:22:33] Haziq KXHL: and idk why winter wonderland is catching strays here
[17/12/25, 15:23:24] Haziq KXHL: lol sorry i can’t turn it off even when i’m sick and in bed i’ll get you all more cookies pls forgive me

[17/12/25, 15:55:51] Haziq KXHL: oh interesting... so if it’s free for regular attendees does that mean you end up charging yourself??
gives self-checkout a whole new meaning wow
[17/12/25, 15:58:30] Haziq KXHL: also consider making your own line of get well soon cards featuring classics like “been there” and “it’s probably because you were enjoying the holiday season”

[19/12/25, 15:10:02] Haziq KXHL: i’m dabbling in the mathematics of “she’s not that into you” aka female mate choice.
specifically the lande-kirkpatrick equilibrium which is deeply cheesy because it says beauty exists just for the sake of being beautiful, not as a proxy for anything useful or optimal
(with the obvious exception of me where evolution experimented with combining aesthetics and competence in a single individual)
[19/12/25, 15:10:47] Haziq KXHL: it might also explain why the human brain evolved music selectivity in the superior temporal gyrus, despite music ability correlating with basically nothing measurable
[19/12/25, 15:11:14] Haziq KXHL: very cheesy. very romantic. deeply unnecessary. christmas has done this to me.
[20/12/25, 21:58:24] Niv Ucl Builder: ill be playing around with a biosensor i got recently!
[20/12/25, 21:58:26] Niv Ucl Builder: https://www.emotibit.com/
[20/12/25, 21:59:16] Pranshul Bohra: fire af
[20/12/25, 22:00:14] Niv Ucl Builder: also a few friends and I will be hosting a christmas party at a group house. feel free to rock up, there will be lots of interesting people there! ‎<This message was edited>

[20/12/25, 22:15:51] Pranshul Bohra: PULL UPPP
[20/12/25, 22:31:27] Haziq KXHL: say hello to our VP everyone, he’s been hiding out god knows where
probably holed up coding in a cabin in the woods or actively dodging OSINT 😶‍🌫️
[20/12/25, 22:33:42] Haziq KXHL: Love this!! i was a certified arduino kid growing up
[20/12/25, 22:36:19] Haziq KXHL: if anyone’s wondering what my role in KXHL is it’s MMC duh of course obviously
[20/12/25, 22:58:04] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Signed uppp ;)
[23/12/25, 18:53:04] Haziq KXHL: morph house is cool
but serious q: funding transparency? donor influence?
not a callout, just academic etiquette

also sorry
sniff sniff
is that EA money
(ftx-era leftovers?)
[23/12/25, 19:13:46] Yi Hein: I think it’s just @⁨Pranshul Bohra⁩’s house right?
[23/12/25, 19:17:02] Yi Hein: Also random thought but, is there a way to incorporate priors about attention to reduce the computational load of the attention matrix?

So for example, given a text with 5000 abstracts. The task is to extract the author names. Surely we don’t need to compute the attention of the abstract content which is 99% of tokens.
[23/12/25, 19:18:30] Yi Hein: as a human, I know to skim/skip through irrelevant parts of the text rather than read each word in detail. But LLMs seems to be computing the full matrix for every single token
[23/12/25, 19:20:29] Pranshul Bohra: Yup
[23/12/25, 19:21:02] ~ Xi2???: funding was from ensemble for like food or sm
[23/12/25, 19:21:02] Niv Ucl Builder: yup its just him! its so fun
[23/12/25, 19:21:12] Pranshul Bohra: 💪
[23/12/25, 19:21:12] ~ Xi2???: snacks* and random stuff
[23/12/25, 19:21:22] ~ Xi2???: but like tldr not really enough to be considered funding anyways
[23/12/25, 19:21:33] ~ Xi2???: so sad cldnt visit today i feel like ass
[23/12/25, 19:21:37] ~ Xi2???: flu gotten to me probs
[23/12/25, 19:21:47] Niv Ucl Builder: no worries. would love to see you here soon! we missed you
[23/12/25, 19:22:06] ~ samia 💗🌸: Yh same the trains near mine are running at really weird times and get cancelled like all the time around Christmas :((
[23/12/25, 19:22:29] Pranshul Bohra: Tctc lil bro
[23/12/25, 20:14:55] Haziq KXHL: lol appreciate the transparency
snacks don’t trigger the conflict-of-interest disclosure forms just yet 😄
and get well soon, hope to catch you at KXHL!!
[23/12/25, 20:55:58] Haziq KXHL: ah this is basically what they called NER in the old days “named entity recognition”.
humans have strong priors over what looks like a name, transformers don’t, so they treat “asdfasdf” and “James Dean” equally.

in practice like ~98% of tokens in a paper are almost certainly not names. humans implicitly know this and skim. a vanilla transformer can’t, so it computes full attention everywhere.

to reduce compute you’d need a learned prior (e.g. an unsupervised or weakly supervised model over name-like strings) to gate or sparsify attention, so you only run full attention on the ~2% of tokens that are plausibly names (plus a small context window).

the prior doesn’t solve the task, it just prunes the search space. that’s where the compute savings come from.
[23/12/25, 20:57:19] Yi Hein: can’t u just add an attention penalty, so it learns those priors automatically?
[23/12/25, 20:58:43] Yi Hein: i am generally against handcrafting priors
[23/12/25, 20:59:14] Yi Hein: like the reason why i learn to look at at the structure of text / entity recognition is because i’m too lazy to do the work of reading every single word
[23/12/25, 20:59:21] Yi Hein: my optimisation function is laziness
[23/12/25, 21:01:10] Haziq KXHL: you can add an attention penalty or regularisation, but that mostly just gives you a very generic prior, like “simpler attention is better” in an Occam’s razor sense.

that encourages sparsity, but it doesn’t tell the model what to be sparse about. it still has to discover, at full cost, that names are special.

humans don’t just have a simplicity prior. we have content specific inductive biases from experience, like what names usually look like and where they tend to appear in text.

if you actually want to add that bias, a probability model over name likeness is the straightforward way to do it. it lets you gate or sparsify attention before you pay the quadratic cost.

regularisation nudges behaviour. an explicit prior changes the search space.
[23/12/25, 21:02:48] Haziq KXHL: humans only do few-shot learning because we ship with hard-coded biases. face recognition is the classic example, there’s basically a proto-face template from birth. learning is fast because the search space is already constrained
[23/12/25, 21:03:17] Yi Hein: but how are those biases encoded though
[23/12/25, 21:03:25] Haziq KXHL: you already have a generative model for names right, just tie your NER to it
[23/12/25, 21:03:28] Yi Hein: kinda hard to store that in DNA
[23/12/25, 21:04:28] Yi Hein: yeah so i’m thinking
[23/12/25, 21:05:30] Yi Hein: like we can generate a bunch of simple tasks like NER, etc. that is required for everyday life, then let the model select which priors they want to use to solve the task
[23/12/25, 21:07:22] Yi Hein: also i’m pretty sure somewhere in the LLM that is specialised function for identifying names, it just doesn’t use it to make itself more efficient
[23/12/25, 21:08:21] Haziq KXHL: you’d be surprised how much behavioural bias is encoded by DNA via natural selection.

a nice example is mate choice in animals. many bird species have incredibly specific preferences for what a mate should look or sound like, and these preferences differ sharply between species. they evolve on surprisingly short timescales and they’re clearly genetically encoded.
[23/12/25, 21:08:47] Haziq KXHL: true story: was a field ecologist before i went down the bioinformatics rabbit hole haha so spent a lot of time with these birds
[23/12/25, 21:14:15] Haziq KXHL: yeah that’s basically agentic / meta-learning
[23/12/25, 21:16:39] Yi Hein: do review papers exist for ML? would be a good opportunity to survey the current work being done to solve these problems
[23/12/25, 21:17:16] Haziq KXHL: yeah generic LLM probably already has name detectors internally. if you take embeddings and project them with UMAP or t-SNE, name-like tokens will cluster separately from normal words. it just doesn’t act on that knowledge to save compute, because attention is unconditional. you need to code that constraint
[23/12/25, 21:20:23] Haziq KXHL: lol the issue isn’t whether review papers exist, it’s the opposite. the field is basically unreviewable at this point.

NeurIPS alone had ~1,100 accepted papers this year and that’s the most selective venue. then you’ve got ICLR, ICML, JMLR, arXiv firehoses, industry blogs, etc. even survey papers go out of date almost immediately.

so yeah there are reviews, but keeping a clean global picture is genuinely hard.

tbh I’m mostly extrapolating from neuro and cog sci here. I don’t really follow ML closely anymore
[23/12/25, 21:21:59] Yi Hein: there’s probably an app that searches the entire papers database to do automated review papers
[23/12/25, 21:22:10] Yi Hein: like a live review paper that constantly gets updated
[23/12/25, 21:24:30] Haziq KXHL: yeah that would actually be very cool
just gotta squint past the occasional hallucinated citation or imaginary theorem
[23/12/25, 21:25:04] Haziq KXHL: maybe it’s just forecasting NeurIPS 2027 who knows
[23/12/25, 21:25:07] Yi Hein: imaginary theorums are just new research directions
[23/12/25, 21:25:54] Yi Hein: member tags are cool haha
[23/12/25, 21:32:29] Haziq KXHL: while we’re discussing maths, seems fair to also discuss the maths of morality (EA)
festive season demands contentious discussion
christmas dinner table rules apply

disclosure: I don’t like EA
[23/12/25, 21:34:42] ~ Alp Duygu: they tried to calculate utility before, ended up justifying lying to a whole nation😔
[23/12/25, 21:34:51] ~ Alp Duygu: careful with maths and morality....
[23/12/25, 21:36:13] Haziq KXHL: 1/ EA math isn’t “wrong”, it’s pathologically wrong.

EA leans on expected value maximisation with unbounded utility functions and probabilities under Knightian uncertainty. this is a known failure mode in decision theory.

once you allow tiny probabilities times astronomically large payoffs, everything collapses into dominance arguments. that’s Pascal’s Wager with better typography (still waiting to spot EA at sunday service... 😑)

add vibes-based counterfactual credit assignment (“this donation saved X lives”, “this career reduced Y risk”) and you’re no longer doing math. you’re telling stories with equations
[23/12/25, 21:38:59] Haziq KXHL: 2/ the inputs are subjective. the probabilities, utilities, and definitions of “impact” are all choices.

that’s why EA isn’t downstream of math. the math is downstream of psychological preference.

subjective inputs destroy claims of neutrality. the task then is psychoanalysis of the preferences encoded in "the math"™️.

the preferences: distance from proximity to real human suffering. abstraction over entanglement. career paths that remain compatible with ambition rather than disrupted by duty. buying a £15m palace in oxford.

this is exactly what Bernard Williams warned about. ethical systems that prize tidiness and optimisation don’t just simplify morality, they anaesthetise it.

moral anesthesia is what happens when a framework reduces our capacity to feel the weight of obligation, while claiming greater rationality for doing so.

cope, but make it haute couture.
[23/12/25, 21:40:43] Haziq KXHL: 3/ and then there’s the tell. somehow this framework reliably ends up taking bullets for tech billionaires while developing an allergy to taxation and welfare states.

which is funny, because compulsory redistribution is literally Peter Singer-style effective altruism done properly. it scales, it’s predictable, and it saves more lives than donor discretion ever will.

EA prefers philanthropy over justice, voluntarism over democracy, and castles over institutions. none of that follows from math. it follows from incentives.

amazing how the math always lands on “don’t tax the guy paying for the math.”
[23/12/25, 22:13:06] ~ manav: sorry for the non-sequitur (agree w/ your broader point) but it’s funny you mention church bc there are strains of EA that are looping back to theism based on baroque probability-driven arguments
[23/12/25, 22:14:11] ~ manav: here’s a good example, think this was presented at a relatively recent EAGx. all judgement devolved to the reader: https://benthams.substack.com/p/the-ultimate-guide-to-the-anthropic
[23/12/25, 22:26:48] Haziq KXHL: ok admin bookkeeping first, welcome Manav!!
thanks so much for chiming in, also I’m chronically annoyed about how quiet this GC is 😭

most exclusive and exciting hack club north of south ken btw 😆
please feel free to make an intro post and tell us a bit about yourself and how you found KXHL

really keen to see you at one of our future sessions!
[23/12/25, 22:28:28] ~ Elma : ‎~ Elma  joined using a group link.
[23/12/25, 22:29:00] Haziq KXHL: wow we started with secular rationality and somehow reinvented medieval theology huh? 
but in LaTeX... 🤭
[23/12/25, 22:29:41] ~ Elma : Hey guys, I’m Elma a friend of Samias!! Im a full time founder and former consulting apprentice - nice to meet you guysss
[23/12/25, 22:30:09] ~ samia 💗🌸: yayyy elma ur here <3!!!!
[23/12/25, 22:30:26] ~ Elma : 😛😛
[23/12/25, 22:30:28] ~ samia 💗🌸: what are you a founder of ?
[23/12/25, 22:30:40] ~ Elma : Apprentice Living
[23/12/25, 22:30:58] ~ Elma : housing and events for young professionals
‎[23/12/25, 22:35:59] Haziq KXHL: 👆 behold… theism!! ✨

when the math wants God, the math wants God ‎image omitted
[23/12/25, 22:36:24] Haziq KXHL: just a reminder that once you let abstract formalism run without constraint, it will justify literally anything. abstraction is malleable like water, a perfect surface for projecting our biases
[23/12/25, 22:37:37] ~ manav: ok sure thing - hey all, i’m a 3rd year medic intercalating in neuroscience. kxhl club actually found me: yi hein and some of the others overheard me and a friend discussing some comp neuro stuff in ucl canteen and offered to add me to the gc. my current research is on whether there is some sort of topographic relationship between the visual field and visual cortex neurones on the single-neurone level, i.e. as i hop from synapse to synapse does that correspond to some defined transformation in visual space. but my white whale is behavioural neuro and psychopathology. current goal is finding a phd project in this area which doesn’t force me to make inferences that cannot be deterministically validated against something measurable…
[23/12/25, 22:39:42] ~ Elma : damn
[23/12/25, 22:41:21] Yi Hein: Here is the translation of Gödel’s Ontological Argument into plain English.
Axiom 1
If a property is positive, and it necessarily implies a second property, then that second property is also positive.
Axiom 2
A property is positive if and only if its negation is not positive.
Theorem 1
If a property is positive, then it is possible that something exists that possesses it.
Definition 1
A being is defined as God-like if and only if it possesses every positive property.
Axiom 3
The property of being God-like is a positive property.
Theorem 2
It is possible that a God-like being exists.
Definition 2
A property is the essence of a being if:
 * The being holds that property, and
 * That property necessarily implies every other property the being holds.
Axiom 4
If a property is positive, then it is necessarily positive.
Theorem 3
If a being is God-like, then the property of being God-like is its essence.
Definition 3
A being has Necessary Existence if and only if the essence of that being is necessarily exemplified (meaning it is necessary that something with that essence exists).
Axiom 5
Necessary Existence is a positive property.
Theorem 4
Necessarily, a God-like being exists.
[23/12/25, 22:41:28] Yi Hein: Got a Gemini translation
[23/12/25, 22:41:46] ~ manav: tbh imo this is a lot more credible than the ‘god because bayesian compartmentalisation’ line of argument
[23/12/25, 22:41:52] Haziq KXHL: to be clear, this doesn’t even reflect badly on theism. claiming “this argument fails therefore God doesn’t exist” would just be an inverse God-of-the-gaps.

I just don’t think questions like theism belong in propositional logic at all. that decision lives elsewhere in things like foundationalism, the substrate of morality,  purpose, lived commitment.
[23/12/25, 22:42:30] ~ manav: yeah 100% agree on para 2
[23/12/25, 22:43:52] ~ manav: tho i think prior to propositional logic is ok…kant argues for a ‘transcendental unity of apperception’ as epistemological assumption for all further reasoning. i guess you’d say this is a kind of foundationalism
[23/12/25, 22:46:12] Haziq KXHL: wowowow bro you are actually cracked 😭
that project sounds insanely cool
please teach me your ways, sensei

I’m first year neuro + organic chem, systems bio RA with Gatsby PhD dreams 🥹
[23/12/25, 22:47:01] ~ manav: way too kind, joined to learn from y’all
[23/12/25, 22:51:34] Yi Hein: Glad to have you here! Are you applying the MBPhd Programme?
[23/12/25, 22:52:08] Haziq KXHL: omg sorry I got carried away and totally missed this, I’m a lousy admin 😭
welcome Elma!!

so happy to have you here and hope to see you at one of our sessions soon
also curious what stage are you at with Apprentice Living? pre-seed, seed etc?
[23/12/25, 22:53:14] Haziq KXHL: for everyone else here’s the startup, check it out:
https://www.apprenticeliving.com/
[23/12/25, 22:55:09] ~ Elma : I need to update the website copy but appreciate the plug
[23/12/25, 22:55:36] ~ manav: yeah i will be
[23/12/25, 22:55:38] Haziq KXHL: “what are you a founder of?” is such a bold question to ask your friend 💀
[23/12/25, 22:57:04] Haziq KXHL: glad to help, adding “VP of marketing, Apprentice Living” to my bio as we speak
[23/12/25, 22:57:06] ~ Elma : Not fundraising any time soon as we don’t need it until we scale the internal tech infrastructure- I would say still Pre- seed but demand is validated and we’re rev generating
[23/12/25, 22:58:17] ~ Elma : The site acc looks like ass so I’m open to any ideas 😩 I don’t have time to make things look pretty but it converts and gets us leads somehow
[23/12/25, 22:58:45] Haziq KXHL: very smart, very smart
validated demand and rev before fundraising is the dream
way to go 👏
[23/12/25, 22:58:56] ~ Elma : Exactly you get it!!!
[23/12/25, 22:59:03] ~ Elma : Is anyone interested in startups here?
[23/12/25, 22:59:32] ~ Elma : We’re actually doing a pitch competition w imperial next year do come if ur around west london area
[23/12/25, 22:59:47] ~ Elma : Just sorting out judges atm
[23/12/25, 22:59:51] Haziq KXHL: gemini 3 💥
[23/12/25, 23:00:54] ~ Elma : I could redo it all on loveable tbf but idk if itd rejig the seo indexing
[23/12/25, 23:01:12] ~ Elma : Would rather not mess w it ngl
[23/12/25, 23:02:01] Haziq KXHL: half the chat, minimum
and a couple people who definitely won’t say they’re VCs but are 🥸
so, hypothetically, anything you say could become a pitch 😬
[23/12/25, 23:02:15] ~ Elma : Whatttt
[23/12/25, 23:02:25] ~ Elma : I thought these folks were students
[23/12/25, 23:02:48] ~ Elma : VC’s at the ripe age of 19 where am i
[23/12/25, 23:02:56] ~ Elma : How old is everyone?
[23/12/25, 23:03:40] ~ Elma : Whens the next meet up in the new year?
[23/12/25, 23:05:26] Haziq KXHL: I’m a startup survivor 😭
worked in a few, tried to launch a few, 100% failure rate (pesky market risk)
turned socialist shortly after (blame Žižek next door at Birkbeck) and haven’t really looked back
so I’m very chill, don’t worry
[23/12/25, 23:05:43] ~ Elma : Oh wow
[23/12/25, 23:05:50] ~ Elma : Where did u work?
[23/12/25, 23:06:34] ~ Elma : Wait what’s the avg age here 😭 you guys have LIVED
[23/12/25, 23:06:36] ~ Elma : I’m 21
[23/12/25, 23:08:28] Haziq KXHL: Couple seed stage startups in Riyadh and Dubai, all went bust
and then was a research intern at GOSH during gap year, genetic engineering proposal won iGEM startups competition
half dozen VCs called, i pitched and then they realised im 18 so they said adios boy Elizabeth Holmes and i came to UCL
[23/12/25, 23:08:53] ~ Elma : what a journey
[23/12/25, 23:09:19] ~ Elma : At least u got to travel and it’s very good exposure early on in ur life
[23/12/25, 23:09:32] ~ Elma : I’ve worked seed and Series A
[23/12/25, 23:09:46] Haziq KXHL: nah the VCs here are cosplaying as 19 year olds... blame the midlife crisis lol
[23/12/25, 23:10:02] ~ Elma : Always check runway before u sign and whos backing
[23/12/25, 23:10:29] ~ Elma : The startup I worked at was backed by Google and EP1 so I knew i was safe this time 🤣
[23/12/25, 23:10:33] ~ Elma : Ah fairs
[23/12/25, 23:12:03] ~ Elma : Well if anyone’s interested in mine lmk! Our clients are employers and we operate in the young professional sector (starting off w apprentices) and avg deal size is 5-6 figures - happy to chat to anyone in residential property/BTR market
[23/12/25, 23:12:08] ~ Elma : Or anyone curious!
[23/12/25, 23:13:12] Haziq KXHL: btw your startup lowkey sounds like a matchmaking app
consider me interested 👀
[23/12/25, 23:13:25] ~ Elma : How 😂😂🤣
[23/12/25, 23:13:39] ~ Elma : It’s litch housing for employers
[23/12/25, 23:13:54] ~ Elma : But we do events as upselling
[23/12/25, 23:15:24] Haziq KXHL: the minute you said “exclusive social events” I knew
the minute you said “meaningful connections” it was over
[23/12/25, 23:15:47] ~ Elma : Ohh on the website
[23/12/25, 23:17:19] ~ Elma : I wouldn’t do anything match making related as it doesnt align with the brand image and conscious of brand rep too
[23/12/25, 23:17:32] ~ Elma : Are u apart of UCL entrepreneurs?
[23/12/25, 23:19:56] Haziq KXHL: no no i have no further interest in the startup world,
now im a biologist (in beta) who believes in public funded research for public benefit 🤦‍♂️
[23/12/25, 23:20:47] ~ Elma : LOOOOL the full u turn is crazy
[23/12/25, 23:20:52] ~ Elma : Fairss
[23/12/25, 23:22:36] Haziq KXHL: understood
matchmaking but make it plausible deniability
[23/12/25, 23:24:03] ~ Elma : ❌❌❌❌❌
[23/12/25, 23:24:30] Haziq KXHL: also is the matchmaking strictly for “young professionals” btw
asking for a friend (me): any love for academia addicts with no career prospects
[23/12/25, 23:25:11] ~ Elma : Omg there is no match making 😭
[23/12/25, 23:25:34] ~ Elma : If you’re interested in events yeah it’s mainly for young professionals but u can come as plus 1
[23/12/25, 23:25:38] ~ Elma : Witj someone
[23/12/25, 23:26:21] ~ Elma : We do partner w student societies so if there’s any cool ones ur apart of I’m happy for the team to sort something
[23/12/25, 23:26:37] ~ Elma : Partnered with UCL ACS a few weeks back which was sweet
[23/12/25, 23:27:31] Samuel KXHL: Zizek birbeck lectures were something else
[23/12/25, 23:27:40] Samuel KXHL: So good
[23/12/25, 23:28:13] Haziq KXHL: right right, not matchmaking
just extremely well-designed proximity
[23/12/25, 23:29:33] Haziq KXHL: see but if I had a +1, we wouldn’t be having this conversation

[23/12/25, 23:32:16] ~ Keanu: I'm an apprentice rn and I've seen a bunch of these (outer circle, leaf pathways) what would you say makes you stand out from the rest?
[23/12/25, 23:32:18] ~ Elma : Calm
[23/12/25, 23:32:34] ~ Elma : We do employer housing we’re not a network x
[23/12/25, 23:32:46] ~ Keanu: Ohh I see
[23/12/25, 23:32:50] ~ Elma : So we’re not in the same market as the ppl u listed
[23/12/25, 23:33:06] ~ samia 💗🌸: Vibes
[23/12/25, 23:33:57] Haziq KXHL: I blinked and missed three plot twists

[23/12/25, 23:36:01] Haziq KXHL: btw if it is of matchmaking interest... I’ve got sick lines like
“you’re the kinda girl people write books about
…DSM-5. hardcover. unabridged. 😳📚”
[23/12/25, 23:36:05] ~ Elma : You have to come pitch on stage and help us win 😩
[23/12/25, 23:37:23] ~ Elma : what is going on
[23/12/25, 23:37:42] Haziq KXHL: add that to my profile on your app pls

[24/12/25, 01:01:44] ~ Keanu: Yes
[24/12/25, 01:40:25] Haziq KXHL: bravo! honestly iconic that we somehow built the world’s first socialist hack club
[24/12/25, 01:44:53] Haziq KXHL: okkk I’ll get on stage and explain my value proposition (me)
[24/12/25, 01:52:32] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Wait what 😂
[24/12/25, 01:52:38] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Trigger words Haziq!!!
[24/12/25, 01:52:46] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Context please 😂
[24/12/25, 01:55:04] Haziq KXHL: hahaha fair
unexpectedly high Žižek per capita
[24/12/25, 01:56:29] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Rare moments I regret not choosing Imperial 😂
‎[24/12/25, 01:56:31] Haziq KXHL: context for anyone confused
yes, this book exists
yes, I own it ‎image omitted
[24/12/25, 01:58:37] Haziq KXHL: imperial’s progressive, just chronically busy
we’re loud because we have bandwidth
[24/12/25, 02:02:10] Haziq KXHL: hmm and how is that data being used...?
GDPR compliance check
[24/12/25, 02:15:42] ~ Suhas: All the ftx money was frozen
[24/12/25, 02:15:50] ~ Suhas: And in some cases retracted
[24/12/25, 02:16:35] ~ Suhas: Do not think there is ftx money floating around
[24/12/25, 02:22:48] ~ Suhas: Figured this might be a place worth asking. I'm in China (Hangzhou, Shanghai) for a couple more days and want to check out some electronics markets. I know it's mostly in Shenzhen but figured there might be some in Hangzhou too. Anyone have any suggestions?
[24/12/25, 02:22:53] ~ Suhas: Maybe @⁨Niv Ucl Builder⁩?
[24/12/25, 07:48:06] Haziq KXHL: bro is always fact-checking me 😭
the hero KXHL needs, but not the one it deserves
kudos and lovely to have you here!! intro post when you're ready 😊
[24/12/25, 07:55:37] ~ Suhas: I'll definitely try to make it to the sessions next term. I've just not had time lately to work on side projects.
[24/12/25, 07:56:49] ~ Suhas: Sorry about the fact checks. Just overly sensitive to EA adjacent critiques 😅
[24/12/25, 09:13:38] ~ Elma : The invite was for @⁨~Keanu⁩ 🧍‍♂️
[24/12/25, 09:38:52] Haziq KXHL: fair fair 😌 he’s defo better at pitching than me
what matters is that someone invests (emotionally)
[24/12/25, 09:39:18] Haziq KXHL: @⁨~Keanu⁩ make it happen pls, best man arc starts now 🤝
[24/12/25, 09:49:20] Haziq KXHL: reminder for newcomers my glib responses are under autonomic nervous control so for the love of god please don’t give me bait
[24/12/25, 09:52:07] Haziq KXHL: if you’re free this evening do join the folks at morph house for the christmas eve social
suspiciously EA adjacent...
[24/12/25, 09:53:34] Niv Ucl Builder: morph has nothing to do with ea 😭
[24/12/25, 09:54:21] Niv Ucl Builder: nope sadly never been but really want to go
[24/12/25, 09:54:52] Niv Ucl Builder: the Chinese audio markets are really good. you can pick up some really impressive headphones for like less than a tenner here
[24/12/25, 09:55:17] Haziq KXHL: right right of course
(but also wouldn’t be the first time EA’s done residential pyramid schemes…)
enjoy your initiation ritua… sorry festivities
[24/12/25, 09:56:05] Haziq KXHL: btw what’s the menu for tonight
I’m not coming but I do have very high standards for christmas eve cuisine nonetheless
[24/12/25, 09:57:06] Niv Ucl Builder: idk yet but I'll cook soon with the group. hopefully we'll decide on something by afternoon
[24/12/25, 09:58:49] Niv Ucl Builder: nah, morph house is independent, unaffiliated, and run by an amazing organizer (@⁨Pranshul Bohra⁩). pranshul just wanted to bring cool people together and he has done an amazing amazing job at it
[24/12/25, 10:01:08] ~ Suhas: Any suggestions? I known nothing about audio but do like deals
[24/12/25, 10:01:21] ~ Suhas: I recognise that it's not really a deal if I wouldn't have spent the money anyways but let's ignore that for a second
[24/12/25, 10:01:29] Yi Hein: https://gemini.google.com/share/ec52958268c9
[24/12/25, 10:01:35] Haziq KXHL: all love, just joking 😭
@⁨Pranshul Bohra⁩ has absolutely smashed it with morph house
I’m just projecting Christmas Eve FOMO from my Kevin McCallister situation
[24/12/25, 10:01:38] Yi Hein: vibe coded LLM browser
[24/12/25, 10:01:48] Yi Hein: every website / link is generated by LLM
[24/12/25, 10:03:16] ~ Suhas: Did you see the future hacker news page?
[24/12/25, 10:03:31] Niv Ucl Builder: definitely look into these things called in ear monitors (they're usually what musicians tend to use at concerts on stage). if you ask any audio store for them, they'll guide you to them. often enough they also let you try them on to see the quality. I think you'll be impressed with how much performance they can pack in
[24/12/25, 10:03:38] ~ Suhas: https://dosaygo-studio.github.io/hn-front-page-2035/news I thought this was really cool
‎[24/12/25, 10:04:42] Yi Hein: Yeah you can go to hackerenws on that generative web browser too ‎image omitted
[24/12/25, 10:05:09] Niv Ucl Builder: my favourite one from when this was launched (if I recall correctly) was "Is functional programming the future"
[24/12/25, 10:05:22] Niv Ucl Builder: I love this sm
[24/12/25, 10:05:26] Niv Ucl Builder: when Gemini flash launched
[24/12/25, 10:05:35] Niv Ucl Builder: I think this was 2 flash
[24/12/25, 10:05:40] Niv Ucl Builder: they showed a demo like this
‎[24/12/25, 10:06:00] ~ Suhas: I think all of them were really good tbh ‎image omitted
[24/12/25, 10:06:03] ~ Suhas: Impressed by Gemini 3's humour
[24/12/25, 10:06:04] Niv Ucl Builder: I remember telling them that this demo would be quite cool to see on a diffusion language model ‎<This message was edited>
[24/12/25, 10:06:22] ~ Suhas: Have you gotten access to the Gemini diffusion beta?
[24/12/25, 10:06:28] ~ Suhas: You can try it out on there
[24/12/25, 10:07:05] Niv Ucl Builder: there was a guy a while back (I think his name was Shaun Mulligan) who tried making this in the gpt 2 days
[24/12/25, 10:07:10] Niv Ucl Builder: it was called looking glass
[24/12/25, 10:07:21] Niv Ucl Builder: he also made some really really really interesting projects
[24/12/25, 10:07:27] Niv Ucl Builder: but the guy was a schizophrenic
[24/12/25, 10:07:47] Niv Ucl Builder: so he would always add in themes of stuff like him being a Messiah
[24/12/25, 10:07:54] Niv Ucl Builder: or how the CIA was after him
[24/12/25, 10:08:30] Niv Ucl Builder: he was a very interesting and creative person. I think he stopped committing stuff on GitHub a year back and deleted all of his old repositories. I wonder where he went
[24/12/25, 10:08:50] ~ Suhas: Clearly the CIA was actually after him
[24/12/25, 10:08:56] Niv Ucl Builder: I remember applying for the waitlist a while back but they never accepted me lol
[24/12/25, 10:09:14] Yi Hein: probably it’s diffusion models are not there yet?
[24/12/25, 10:09:16] Niv Ucl Builder: 😭😭
[24/12/25, 10:09:28] Niv Ucl Builder: the Gemini one is quite good
[24/12/25, 10:09:42] Niv Ucl Builder: and I think the open source ones are also getting way better by the day
[24/12/25, 10:09:44] ~ Suhas: Ah I have the beta and it's like 2-2.5 flash levels. So not quite good enough for this
[24/12/25, 10:09:47] Niv Ucl Builder: maybe in like a year or two
‎[24/12/25, 10:09:50] Yi Hein: Shaun mulligan… ‎image omitted
[24/12/25, 10:10:13] Niv Ucl Builder: OH FUCK WHAT
[24/12/25, 10:10:18] Niv Ucl Builder: let me check if that's the same guy
[24/12/25, 10:10:19] ~ Suhas: While at GDM there was a talk by someone who works on the diffusion models and in general they seem super bullish on this
[24/12/25, 10:10:36] ~ Suhas: As an architecture
[24/12/25, 10:12:05] Niv Ucl Builder: nvm that's not him
[24/12/25, 10:12:16] Niv Ucl Builder: his name was Shane Mulligan instead
[24/12/25, 10:12:34] Niv Ucl Builder: I remember archiving his browser thing (he has since deleted it from the internet)
[24/12/25, 10:12:56] Niv Ucl Builder: yeah I've been really fascinated with them too
[24/12/25, 10:13:29] Niv Ucl Builder: a person who used to be quite active in our ML reading club is now doing their PHD on diffusion lm alignment stuff
[24/12/25, 10:13:55] ~ Suhas: Link?
[24/12/25, 10:15:38] Niv Ucl Builder: https://skye.purchasethe.uk
[24/12/25, 10:17:42] Niv Ucl Builder: GUYS

[24/12/25, 10:18:15] Niv Ucl Builder: this is the same guy (you can verify this through his GitHub profile)
[24/12/25, 10:18:40] Niv Ucl Builder: im glad to have archived all of his ramblings
[24/12/25, 10:18:54] Niv Ucl Builder: I was wondering why he became inactive
[24/12/25, 10:28:51] Yi Hein: That’s crazy

[24/12/25, 13:50:07] Haziq KXHL: how’s the turkey coming along btw
should be thawed/brining by now right? how we looking
[24/12/25, 13:53:29] Haziq KXHL: and what are we thinking for dessert?
would’ve actually been fun to bake something for you guys if i were there
festive season has me practicing for my inevitable british bake off debut lol
[24/12/25, 13:54:11] Haziq KXHL: just casually whipped up walnut caramel cinnamon rolls and a dark chocolate ganache marble cake 😮‍💨
kanellängd and babka up next
[24/12/25, 14:13:37] ~ Manish R. Naicker: got extra?
[24/12/25, 14:32:13] Haziq KXHL: absolutely i’d deliver it to you personally if i could but i’m away for hols
i don’t even like eating as much as baking, body being a temple and all that (lol) so i give most of it away anyway
[24/12/25, 15:00:36] Haziq KXHL: @⁨~Elma ⁩
ok but respectfully
i bake too much and need someone to eat it
surely this is an Apprentice Living problem to solve
[24/12/25, 15:51:22] ~ Elma : Do u wanna bake for the next event
[24/12/25, 15:52:20] ~ Elma : I would happily take the goods queen!!!
[24/12/25, 15:55:17] ~ samia 💗🌸: I volunteer to eat

[24/12/25, 16:13:13] ~ Aditya Gupta: Hi guys, I joined the group a few weeks ago but forgot to introduce myself. I'm Aditya and am currently an intern at an AI safety startup :)
[24/12/25, 16:37:40] Haziq KXHL: wow everyone is obsessed with me
[24/12/25, 16:37:49] Haziq KXHL: i was playing hard to get
[24/12/25, 16:39:32] Haziq KXHL: watching a founder refuse matchmaking demand when Hinge is literally right there is kind of iconic
[24/12/25, 16:41:30] Haziq KXHL: I can bake
but unfortunately I only bake for someone I’d share the last slice with 🥺
tragic, I know
[24/12/25, 16:42:52] Haziq KXHL: rich coming from someone who’s missed 5 bake sales and counting
[24/12/25, 16:43:58] ~ Elma : Bro was selling dreams
[24/12/25, 16:44:05] Haziq KXHL: btw been watching Meghan’s Christmas show for baking inspo, zero talent whatsoever, but Harry still rates it
now that’s product-market fit, take notes @⁨~Elma ⁩
[24/12/25, 16:44:28] ~ samia 💗🌸: Ouch
[24/12/25, 16:54:34] Haziq KXHL: selling myself mostly
which raises the question, am I the dream
and whose dream
answering that is kind of your job no?

Apprentice Living: absolutely NOT a matchmaking platform btw 🤥
[24/12/25, 16:58:39] Haziq KXHL: wow the emotional and semantic density you compress into monosyllables like “hmm” and “ouch” is an art form
such economy
truly spectacular
[24/12/25, 17:19:12] ~ Keanu: your wordplay is absolutely impeccable, respect @⁨Haziq KXHL⁩ 🫡
[24/12/25, 17:59:38] Haziq KXHL: why thank you!
wordplay is just socialist cope
if I’m gonna be broke, I’m gonna be broke with an attitude and a protagonist complex
[24/12/25, 18:05:23] Haziq KXHL: on a more academic note, I’m reacting to the phenomenon of modal collapse in communicative media. everybody sounds the damn same.

partly this is driven by AI slop. we’ve hit the tipping point where humans are learning from AI instead of the other way round. partly it’s social media compressing emotional range into a handful of monosyllables. partly it’s corporate culture convincing people there’s merit in sounding like a robot instead of being a little authentic.

behaviourally this shows up as people running an internal probability model before they speak. “is this something others or an AI would typically say?” and that right there is the problem.
[24/12/25, 18:07:16] Haziq KXHL: also btw 6× pitching comp winner and SWE at ARM, son of a gun 🔥
we need you in our hacking sessions

welcome aditya!! great to have you here
an AI internship in this economy??? bloody hell that’s insane, huge kudos 🔥

[25/12/25, 17:58:28] ~ manav: This is so sick
[25/12/25, 18:02:13] ~ manav: Been doomscrolling a ton these holidays and don’t have the self discipline to tear myself away from the algo gods so I made this silly little Odysseus pact webtool that obfuscates screen time passcode entry on iPhone and lets you send the passcode to a friend/loved one via link, so you can leverage 2am guilt to hold your 10am self accountable
[25/12/25, 18:02:22] ~ manav: Available here: passcode.ponnekanti.net
[25/12/25, 18:06:02] ~ manav: Major head-scratcher was how to handle the temporary link that holds your passcode so you can send to a friend. At first I tried a SQL backend and cloudflare workers to dynamically generate the webpages but then I realised I can just encode the passcode in the URL itself in base64 LMAO
[25/12/25, 18:08:13] Yi Hein: omg yeah screen time never works for me because i just unlock it all the time haha
[25/12/25, 18:09:10] ~ manav: I’m so locked in with IG reels that I have the “allow 15 minutes” click flow down to like 3 secs
[25/12/25, 19:26:08] Haziq KXHL: this is incredible 😭 you guys are shipping too much for the season… someone please drop some casual activities, good to touch snow... sorry grass once in a while
[25/12/25, 19:30:03] Haziq KXHL: zero sanctimony but my parents baptised me in long-form content since birth so now my body is allergic to social media
[25/12/25, 20:24:52] ~ samia 💗🌸: Knitting or crocheting
[25/12/25, 20:40:34] Haziq KXHL: what we knitting? im quite partial to pointelle shirts 🙂‍↕️ crochet shirts also slap, literally one in my dp
[25/12/25, 20:42:01] Haziq KXHL: not the most sensible choice for winter, but im in summer 365 and i like to make a fashion statement
[25/12/25, 20:42:27] ~ samia 💗🌸: I’m not that advanced yet 😭
[25/12/25, 20:45:10] Haziq KXHL: I’m not even angry, I’m just disappointed 🤨
[25/12/25, 20:45:26] ~ samia 💗🌸: I made one jumper once
[25/12/25, 20:45:35] ~ samia 💗🌸: The arms were rlly nice but the torso bit was so bad lol
[25/12/25, 20:51:39] Haziq KXHL: I think you don’t get it... you’re talking to the could’ve-been heir of a minor fashion empire that went bust in the 90s. my grandparents were knitwear virtuosi. i inherited only taste and high standards
[25/12/25, 20:53:30] Haziq KXHL: but it’s ok i’ll give you participation marks
[25/12/25, 20:54:05] Haziq KXHL: on that note, changing my group tag, bona fide swifties will get it

[26/12/25, 03:31:58] Haziq KXHL: oh my god i completely forgot my christmas dinner table techno-ethics rant. anyway it’s 3:30am which is basically business hours at KXHL so here goes...
[26/12/25, 03:39:44] Haziq KXHL: *1/ legality is doing moral laundering and tech knows it*

recently saw a startup trying to build an uber for nurses (investigative journalism by Cory Doctorow). flexible shifts, efficiency, empowerment, etc. except they factor in credit history so when nurses are most desperate they get paid the least. dynamic pricing they say. legally defensible they say. a phrase that has never once preceded good news.

if you’ve been in an ER any time recently you’d take a bullet for these people, no exaggeration. understaffed, burned out, holding the system together with tape and caffeine, and this is what the algorithm sees. an arbitrage opportunity, the hippocratic oath but make it fintech.

here’s the problem. it is legal, and that’s not a gotcha, that’s the indictment. legality is being used as a proxy for ethics, and proxies only work while they’re not targets. once legality becomes the thing you optimise for it stops constraining behaviour and starts shaping it. goodhart’s law, yes that one.

so yes this clears legal review. that doesn’t mean it’s ethical. it means the system did exactly what it was asked to do. hit the proxy, miss the target.

legality isn’t the tablet handed down from mount sinai, it’s a lagging signal. it updates after people invent new ways to exploit others without tripping enforcement. so when people ask why tech companies don’t behave responsibly they’re asking why the big bad wolf didn’t stop to have tea with little red riding hood’s grandma. wrong genre. you’re watching capitalism and asking for character development.

we don’t have a tech ethics problem, we have a political failure problem. lawmakers captured, regulators asleep, and then we act surprised when companies optimised for extraction behave accordingly. expecting them to exceed the standards we collectively set isn’t idealism, it’s fantasy.
[26/12/25, 03:43:32] Haziq KXHL: *2/ exploitation does not become altruism just because you ran it through a spreadsheet*

same pattern globally. operations moved to the global south because labour protections are weaker, corruption is cheaper, and deaths are easier to externalise. people collapsing in warehouses, factories that look like sweatshops with better branding, and then the lie appears right on cue.

without these jobs they’d be starving. some income is better than none. you’re imposing western standards.

DO NOT BUY THIS.

if this were actually about utility maximisation the obscene surplus upstream would be used to improve conditions downstream. instead we get profit, and then profit at the expense of lives, and whenever the second option is available it gets chosen (it’s called SyNeRgY in decks btw).

this shouldn’t even be defensible under classical effective altruism. singer’s whole intervention was that distance does not diminish moral weight, a life doesn’t become cheaper because it’s far away or inconvenient, that was literally the point. and yet this is exactly where modern EA lands. western lives are more valuable because they can earn more, donate more, optimise better. future lives are more important because they don’t disrupt present comfort. suffering now is acceptable if it preserves the machinery that produces high impact later.

the evidence always looks clean because of how it’s sampled. outcomes are measured only among those who remain. those who are injured drop out. those who die disappear entirely. the dataset improves as the harm increases. survivorship bias.
[26/12/25, 03:47:07] Haziq KXHL: *3/ why this is tolerated*

because distance works. abstraction works. and we’ve trained ourselves to confuse compliance with morality. look at how we teach ethics now, even the active bystander training at ucl. you’re not told that harassment, abuse, and assault are intrinsically evil, you’re told not to engage in them because it might cost you. legal consequences, reputational risk, career damage, moral philosophy but make it HR.

no language of wrongness, just incentives. this is moral anaesthesia, and when ethics is reduced to risk management we shouldn’t be surprised when people learn to tolerate atrocity as long as it’s priced in.

this is why proximity matters. if you’re close enough to suffering you stop being able to tolerate it. things that seem acceptable on paper become obviously wrong when you see them directly. distance makes exploitation easier to justify, abstraction makes it easier to look away.

[27/12/25, 10:46:48] Yi Hein: i mean in terms of routing to the right panel of experts
[27/12/25, 10:47:06] Yi Hein: like the best answer that collective humans can give vs ai
[27/12/25, 10:47:11] ~ Suhas: Ah
[27/12/25, 10:47:43] ~ Suhas: I mean every model release they do have benchmarks reported which are along these lines right? What % of queries on X scientific topic did human annotators prefer the model response over the expert response
[27/12/25, 10:48:35] ~ Suhas: But in general I think the average lmarena user would overrate the model response over the expert response since they wouldn't necessarily be able to check the accuracy
[27/12/25, 10:48:37] Yi Hein: oh yeah that’s true
[27/12/25, 10:49:43] ~ Suhas: fwiw labs do use lmarena datasets for evals / post training (and might commission experts to write responses) so this kind of thing does happen using real user queries ‎<This message was edited>
[27/12/25, 10:51:45] Yi Hein: ALSO guys, what if we do post-training pipeline that specifically teaches scientific discovery? kind of like backtesting but for science. 

so like train the model on math/ML until 2010s knowledge. then train it so that it is able to make the right discoveries to arrive at the transformer architecture
[27/12/25, 10:53:20] Yi Hein: so like next-discovery prediction, the training data is the history of human discovery. then we use the model to generate new discoveries. so having time filters on the training data

[27/12/25, 11:06:47] ~ Suhas: and this project: https://x.com/i/status/2001688613055267204
[27/12/25, 11:08:05] ~ Suhas: I think it's a super interesting goal. It's difficult with anything too far back because there's just limited training data (and preventing contamination is also tricky).
[27/12/25, 11:08:25] Niv Ucl Builder: I remember seeing this market and thinking that it was really cool!
[27/12/25, 11:10:58] Yi Hein: woah that’s cool
[27/12/25, 11:11:43] Yi Hein: i wonder if we can guide it’s reasoning in the post-training phase to be better at discoveries
[27/12/25, 11:12:17] ~ Suhas: I work part-time at a startup trying to create AI powered forecasters (for geopolitics / things like that) and in my experience temporal contamination is pretty hard to deal with for scraped data. ‎<This message was edited>
[27/12/25, 11:12:39] ~ Suhas: There's also the question of look-ahead bias in what kind of data you'd choose to include etc even if it was all created before the cut-off
[27/12/25, 11:35:23] Haziq KXHL: yeah but then that’s basically overfitting lol

in real backtesting you fit on data <2010, make predictions on >2010, then you shut up and report error. no tweaking params, no training toward the answer. anything else is fraud

if you train the model so it “arrives at transformers,” you’re supervising it on the future. that’s not discovery, that’s hindsight fitting
[27/12/25, 11:39:08] Yi Hein: ah i see, because there are many valuable discoveries / alternative paths that are good that human’s didn’t do. and trying to evaluate the quality of the discoveries generated by AI manually will be very intensive
[27/12/25, 11:39:57] Haziq KXHL: also more fundamentally, for a pure generative model the question “did it discover X?” is kind of ill-posed

if the model assigns non-zero probability to something, then with enough samples it’ll eventually say it. infinite monkey typewriter theorem

so sampling until it outputs “transformer” tells you nothing about understanding or prediction, just that it was somewhere in the support

and if you start nudging it toward specific things like transformers, you’re not measuring discovery anymore, you’re just encouraging modal collapse

at that point you’ve forced a mode, not learned whether the model actually prioritizes the idea
[27/12/25, 11:44:48] Yi Hein: i mean transformers is only 1 example right. the general idea is synthesising existing concepts and utilising it to make the next discovery. so you can have many fields, each incremental discovery is training data, so training on 2001->2002, 2007->2008 etc…. so for example you put training cut off at 2010. and we test on > 2010, so test set will be predictions of 2010->2011, 2011->2012 etc.
[27/12/25, 11:49:48] Haziq KXHL: ok but now you’re kind of shifting the goalposts a bit

what you’re describing now is supervised learning, which is actually much more interesting

but then the hard part is defining the conditioning and the targets. it’s not like you can feed in “all of 2001” and expect “2002” to pop out
[27/12/25, 11:52:52] Haziq KXHL: yeah I rate this one, it’s a great paper. but it’s doing something pretty different from the “rediscover transformers” idea

what they’re exploiting is that materials papers already contain a ton of latent forward-looking info in the results and discussion sections. the embeddings are basically compressing that structure and surfacing structure-property relationships that were implied

that’s actually much closer to classic language based discovery and literature mining, which is a whole established field
[27/12/25, 11:59:21] Haziq KXHL: more abstractly, scientific discovery itself is basically a sequence of covariate shifts in the distribution of human knowledge
any statistical model trained to capture yesterday’s distribution is always fighting a losing battle there, because the object it’s modeling keeps moving
[27/12/25, 12:32:49] Yi Hein: but what i’m saying is not training on the distribution but training it to learn who to do those shifts in distributions
[27/12/25, 14:11:55] Haziq KXHL: sorry got caught up with a baking project. babka today. yiddish dessert. basically brioche braided like a DNA double helix
[27/12/25, 14:12:10] Haziq KXHL: bossman just dropped a NeurIPS 2026 idea
[27/12/25, 14:12:48] Haziq KXHL: okkk so what you’re suggesting is basically a time-evolving generative model f(x;θ), where the parameters themselves are treated as a dynamical system, something like dθ/dt=…
[27/12/25, 14:13:29] Haziq KXHL: that’s actually pretty cracked and, in principle, could adapt to covariate shift. there’s some precedent in hypernetworks, where parameters are outputs of another neural net, but as far as I know nobody has really learned a genuine dynamical model over parameter space
[27/12/25, 14:14:00] Haziq KXHL: people have tried to handle covariate shift before using online learning and adaptation but this is definitely more ambitious
[27/12/25, 14:15:04] Haziq KXHL: with that said, it’s probably not going to work for text based scientific discovery. you’re immediately hit by a curse of dimensionality. if it takes billions of parameters to capture the knowledge distribution of a single year, and you only have a few decades of data, then learning meaningful dynamics in that space is massively underdetermined
[27/12/25, 14:19:25] Haziq KXHL: i there’s massive potential for AI in scientific discovery and target finding, I just don’t think LLMs or NLP-heavy approaches are the answer

stuff like Evo2 is genuinely insane. being able to probe evolution directly and test the fitness of synthetic genetic constructs in silico before going anywhere near in vitro experiments is exactly the kind of leverage AI should be giving us

that feels much closer to real scientific acceleration than trying to get language models to hallucinate breakthroughs
[27/12/25, 14:22:30] Haziq KXHL: https://www.futurehouse.org/fellowship-program

[27/12/25, 15:09:34] ~ Suhas: Us capitalists have to do our bit
[27/12/25, 15:15:21] ~ manav: I’m broadly on your team in terms of desired outcomes (I’m a medic ffs) but it’s so easy to criticise inefficient allocation by markets, cartelisation, tax evading gorillionaires etc. 99% of people want the same stuff as you but the real question is can you conceive of a more efficient alternative? Like do we want command economies or what
[27/12/25, 15:16:45] ~ manav: Meant to reply to Haziq lol
[27/12/25, 15:22:38] Haziq KXHL: I don’t think the choice is “Kalshi or Gosplan”.

The alternative isn’t a command economy, it’s democratic control over essentials and constraints on capital where incentives go pathological.

In domains like public health, elections, and war, coupling information to profit is actively perverse.
[27/12/25, 15:28:42] Haziq KXHL: in terms of constraints on capital, I’m basically citing Piketty. the argument isn’t anti-market, it’s that unconstrained capital accumulation breaks both democracy and efficiency, so you need progressive taxation, inheritance taxes, and forms of social ownership to re-steer investment

and in terms of democratising essentials, that’s exactly what Mamdani is trying to do. decommodify things like housing, healthcare, and public goods, and bring them under democratic control rather than leaving them to market allocation
[27/12/25, 15:29:13] ~ manav: Yeah I’m not arguing that pumping shitcoins is load bearing to civilisational security or anything. Moreso that the entire apparatus of socialist rhetoric and theory to these pretty mild ideas (certain inelastic markets benefit from regulation) that are well within the Overton window lowkey just feels like attaching a redundant mythology to normie social liberalism. Which is fine! West Berlin Thought produced good outcomes
[27/12/25, 15:34:46] ~ manav: A couple days ago people were glazing Zizek on here. One of the things I don’t like about him is this exact tendency. His most recent philosophical turn is “dialectical history is broken, the revolution is not a historical act but a continual attitude of resistance towards the radical metaphysical uncertainty of the future”. What’s he actually proposing, ground level, that is distinguished from normie lib ideas yk? It feels like the whole left is labouring under the weight of Marx and we would all be better of if we abundance-pilled and presented our policy ideas unburdened by all of this theoretical baggage
[27/12/25, 15:34:56] Haziq KXHL: not using theory to make the ideas sound radical, using it to explain why normie social liberalism keeps collapsing back into rent-seeking capitalism unless you actively constrain capital. this is where Žižek’s critique fits. the issue isn’t ignorance, it’s that normie social liberalism is psychologically comfortable with being complicit in exploitation as long as it’s abstracted and morally disavowed.

theory isn’t there to radicalize mild policies, it’s there to explain why people happily support them in principle and then resist them the moment they actually constrain capital.
[27/12/25, 15:35:28] Haziq KXHL: istg i hit enter same time as you lollll
[27/12/25, 15:37:39] Haziq KXHL: that’s fair tbh. I’m a neuro/psych student with a humanities background so im sorta partial to theoretical waffling and unprompted psychoanalysing
[27/12/25, 15:38:01] ~ manav: I reject the idea that anything beyond a basic Marxist humanism (atomisation of labour leading to entfremdung, work as gattungswesen, people should not starve and die or suffer disease, blah blah) actually produces good or desirable policies which help people. If your theory leads you to rent controls instead of a land value tax then of what value was the theorising
[27/12/25, 15:40:51] ~ manav: Something funny is that for certain periods in the USSR, scientists had to present all of their ideas in terms of dialectics. Obviously many phenomena in nature and physics are non-dialectical, so soviet scientists were at a competitive disadvantage for having to shoehorn theory into their work. I believe that theory constrains politics in the same way
[27/12/25, 15:42:30] Haziq KXHL: yes I agree that theory is bad if it leads to worse outcomes, and no one here is romanticising the USSR or command economies

but note that Žižek’s theory isn’t phenomenological or programmatic at all. he’s not promoting Soviet-style politics or a return to communism

what he’s doing instead is diagnosing why even empirically good, normie social-liberal policies keep failing to stick. it’s a critique of ideological comfort and political inertia, not a policy prescription

so I don’t read Žižek as “rent control over LVT”. I read him as explaining why we keep circling the same obvious solutions and still can’t implement them
[27/12/25, 15:46:02] ~ manav: Yeah I think diagnosis is always a credible arena for theory. Esp in the current moment where we’re seeing resurrection of might makes right, friend-enemy distinction, etc on the right. But I think at least half of the problem is that our theory has failed to produce credible alternatives. Like we had Mark Fisher talk about “radically reimagining political realities to escape capitalist realism”, Zizek singing the same tune pretty often, etc etc. but no one actually articulates this new positive vision
[27/12/25, 15:48:05] ~ manav: In reality, the only thing that seems capable of radically disrupting the social fabric in the way that a lot of these theorists seem to desire is technological progress and leftist theory of technology is a huge meme. We’re stuck talking about AI water use and shit
[27/12/25, 15:50:42] Haziq KXHL: true. a lot of what gets called “political theory” today is really an offshoot of ethics and philosophy, not economic design or institutional engineering

but I don’t think that means the positive vision is missing, it’s just living somewhere else. it’s in economics, policy research, public administration, and even boring institutional work rather than high theory

we actually do know what to do. progressive taxation and wealth taxes, land value taxes, decommodifying essentials, public investment, universal services, constraints on speculative capital. none of this is mysterious or utopian, it’s been articulated pretty clearly
[27/12/25, 15:52:15] ~ manav: Yus this wraps back to my original point. Then it’s just a question of positioning, optics and pragmatism right?
[27/12/25, 15:52:27] Haziq KXHL: honestly that’s why I mostly invoke Žižek for drama. actually reading him gives me an aneurysm half the time because he’s on some Freud psychosexual detour and I’m just sitting there like ok but how should the country be run 😵‍💫
[27/12/25, 15:53:14] ~ manav: He’s great entertainment for sure. Have you come across his bit about French vs German vs Anglo toilets
[27/12/25, 15:54:39] Haziq KXHL: nothing says “rigorous political theory” like deriving national ideology from toilet hydraulics 🤣😭 ‎<This message was edited>
[27/12/25, 15:55:49] ~ manav: Which is why of the options on the table I back Silicon Valley abundanceslop. Find me someone with a political platform that’s more aligned w what we want than Garry Tan lmfao
[27/12/25, 15:57:39] ~ manav: Ok sure you probably lose heavy wealth taxes because of industry capture, but you’re not getting that even with AOC or whatever because congress is lobbied af. But you get efficient and functioning state apparatus that is nominally empirical in its decision making
[27/12/25, 15:59:16] Haziq KXHL: i sorta get the appeal of abundance politics and I agree tech-driven growth matters. the Piketty point though is that inequality does not fix itself through the abundance or capitalistic engine

historically productivity gains and growth just compound upward unless you actively constrain capital through taxation, redistribution, and democratic control. abundance makes redistribution easier, but it doesn’t do it for free

so I’m not anti-abundance at all, I just don’t buy that “build more” substitutes for political economy. without constraints, abundance just scales rent extraction faster
[27/12/25, 16:02:16] ~ Arinze: Hey I’ve been absent for a while. But wanted to ask, is everyone on here still coding legit or now vibe coding?
[27/12/25, 16:03:22] Haziq KXHL: capture is real but it’s not immutable. Zohran’s success shows there’s room for this kind of politics. if that model keeps winning locally, others will follow. that’s how the Overton window actually moves
[27/12/25, 16:04:14] Haziq KXHL: to keep winning locally we basically need an entire ecosystem of people like you, me, and unfortunately Žižek yelling about toilets in the background
[27/12/25, 16:05:43] ~ manav: Eagerly waiting to see what happens in NYC, whether network effects of being there outweigh increased taxes for businesses etc. Really not a fan of his rent controls, we all know housing is a supply issue
[27/12/25, 16:07:09] ~ manav: Bro I wish I had your optimism. US-wise we’re contending with a voter base that is fine with abolishing dirt cheap USAID to own the browns. Age of pure tribalism
[27/12/25, 16:09:23] ~ manav: I mostly vibecode any actual work bc time is a constraint but I try to hand code small personal projects to prevent skills atrophy
[27/12/25, 16:14:40] Haziq KXHL: yeah I think there’s a similar dynamic in the UK with Reform. you’ve got a large white working-class demographic with low educational attainment, which itself is a product of long-run inequality

during a cost-of-living crisis, people are under real material stress and become much more receptive to simple, emotionally satisfying explanations offered by bad actors at the top. so blame gets redirected toward migrants or other marginal groups, instead of toward structural economic causes

that redirection is kind of the point. it stops people from ever getting to “oh, actually progressive economic politics might be the solution”

historically this pattern is very well documented. in Weimar Germany, severe economic crisis and social collapse created the conditions where elites and demagogues successfully redirected anger toward Jews instead of capital, landowners, or institutions. the result was catastrophic

it’s not about people being irrational or uniquely bad, it’s about inequality, stress and propaganda working together
[27/12/25, 16:16:16] Haziq KXHL: but despite all that, my optimism comes from volunteer work. when you’re actually on the ground, people know you’re on their side and that you’re not the enemy. that kind of trust cuts through a lot of the noise in a way national politics just doesn’t
[27/12/25, 16:19:04] Yi Hein: yeah agree with @⁨~manav⁩ , i vibe code to prototype ideas etc., i code completely from scratch if i am learning
[27/12/25, 16:19:59] ~ Suhas: Before opus 4.5 it was like 20-30% of my work. After opus 4.5 it's probably like 75% (including personal projects, research, actual work) ‎<This message was edited>
[27/12/25, 16:20:36] ~ manav: Do you use Claude code or just chat interface
[27/12/25, 16:20:41] ~ Suhas: Claude code with max ‎<This message was edited>
[27/12/25, 16:21:17] ~ manav: Nice
[27/12/25, 16:21:51] ~ Suhas: I've won a few hackathons with Claude code doing basically all the work so I view it as having paid for itself ‎<This message was edited>
[27/12/25, 16:22:10] ~ manav: Lmao v cool
[27/12/25, 16:22:51] ~ manav: Do you run it unsafe? I feel like I haven’t really gotten into the workflow because giving permission every time is irritating
[27/12/25, 16:23:21] ~ manav: In a way that gpt insertion or Gemini copy/paste isn’t
[27/12/25, 16:23:29] ~ Suhas: Yeah I do
[27/12/25, 16:23:47] ~ Suhas: I've not been burned by it so far because of frequent committing but I think I'll definitely be burned by it some time soon ‎<This message was edited>
[27/12/25, 16:24:13] ~ manav: Did you hear about that guy whose whole drive got rm -rf’ed by Claude code
[27/12/25, 16:24:20] ~ manav: That’s what scares me
[27/12/25, 16:24:39] ~ manav: It was top story on HN a week ago
[27/12/25, 16:24:39] ~ Suhas: It doesn't have sudo permission. I don't think it can do that
[27/12/25, 16:25:04] ~ Suhas: Was that Gemini cli?
[27/12/25, 16:26:02] ~ manav: No it was Claude code with —dangerously-skip-permissions flag
[27/12/25, 16:26:06] ~ manav: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46268222
[27/12/25, 16:26:54] ~ manav: Quite funny tbh. “Why did my —explode-my-house flag explode my house”
[27/12/25, 16:27:00] ~ Suhas: Seems like Claude. Probably something to watch for. They definitely need a better permissions model for commands being run. I think cursor has something where you can define freeform rules for the types of commands that can be run and have a model check it against that.

[27/12/25, 16:27:34] ~ manav: Was thinking of setting it up in a NixOS box
[27/12/25, 16:27:35] ~ Suhas: Did* now it's built in I think?
[27/12/25, 16:27:58] ~ Suhas: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sandboxing seems like they might've added some sandboxing for the bash tool
[27/12/25, 16:28:03] ~ manav: Ah nice
[27/12/25, 16:31:36] ~ manav: Idk if anyone else has felt this but even in the immediately previous gen of models, they would sometimes write loads of hacky slop code to implement something from scratch that might already be a feature in the framework you’re using
[27/12/25, 16:31:40] ~ manav: But this never happens anymore
[27/12/25, 16:32:01] ~ manav: Models are tasteful now. Generally my code is really nice
[27/12/25, 16:32:22] ~ Suhas: I still see this but it's definitely a lot less frequent
[27/12/25, 16:32:50] ~ Suhas: Usually with larger codebases where it misses some pattern or doesn't realise it can modify some other API which would result in adding a lot less code
[27/12/25, 16:34:39] ~ Suhas: The flip side is that it's pretty cool how it'll use code to do things a human would never write a script to do ordinarily. I've seen that a lot more with opus 4.5. It feels creative but it's probably just the labs RLing a lot on OSWorld type benchmarks. ‎<This message was edited>

[27/12/25, 21:06:43] Haziq KXHL: Hello yes hi 😤 this VERY IMPORTANT inquiry has been tragically lost under math debates and political hot takes. @⁨~Elma ⁩ I am now submitting an official FOI request. I want ANSWERS
[27/12/25, 21:07:39] ~ Elma : Omg Haziq I was gna reply to you but I was out all day!!! Litch only got home earlier
[27/12/25, 21:08:17] ~ Elma : Ok re event space we have some lovely investors,business owners etc that sponsor us and partnership venues
[27/12/25, 21:08:59] ~ Elma : It’s all just relationship building the imperial partnership event will be held at the stunning Kindred in West London! All sponsored owner is lovely
[27/12/25, 21:09:03] Haziq KXHL: You’re taking this matter too lightly 🙄 this is my character development we’re talking about…
[27/12/25, 21:09:12] ~ Elma : Wdym
[27/12/25, 21:09:45] ~ Elma : Stop speaking in riddles 😔
[27/12/25, 21:10:10] Haziq KXHL: Still denying the matchmaking outfit I see 👀
[27/12/25, 21:10:30] ~ Elma : Not denying it’s a definitive no 🤣
[27/12/25, 21:10:58] Haziq KXHL: That’s actually super impressive, kudos for achieving all that while still being pre seed 🔥
[27/12/25, 21:11:14] Haziq KXHL: Not saying it for matchmaking credits btw, honest
[27/12/25, 21:15:06] Haziq KXHL: Stunning you say??? Ok im definitely crashing, let’s see if those Disney movies were legit. Just need to think of something iconic to leave behind 🤔 Cinderella had her glass slippers, any suggestions…?
[27/12/25, 21:16:57] ~ Elma : Why don’t u bring @⁨Yi Hein⁩ as ur date and call it a day
[27/12/25, 21:17:47] ~ Elma : thanks I try my best
[27/12/25, 21:18:05] Haziq KXHL: Nahhh he’s already locked in as my best man. Can’t waste the casting like that 😌
[27/12/25, 21:18:58] Haziq KXHL: Wow a humble founder?? New species just dropped
[27/12/25, 21:19:29] ~ Elma : let the man soeak for himself 🗣️🗣️
[27/12/25, 21:19:45] ~ Elma : What if he wanted to be next to you????

[27/12/25, 21:27:21] Haziq KXHL: that’s literally the best man’s job, just gotta be on the other side of the bride 🤦‍♂️ 
top tier matchmaker like you should know these deets 🙄
[27/12/25, 21:28:16] ~ Elma : This is feeling sexist ngll
[27/12/25, 21:28:35] ~ Elma : How many founders are u calling a matchmaker or is it just me
[27/12/25, 21:29:47] Haziq KXHL: it’s your messaging/marketing phrasing that kinda begs for these jokes. Also im generally annoying, sorry not sorry 😌
[27/12/25, 21:33:46] ~ Ada Ge: what's the event in question?
[27/12/25, 21:34:14] ~ Elma : It’s a pitch night event
[27/12/25, 21:34:43] ~ Elma : For imperial students/apprentice living members (apprentices/young professionals)
[27/12/25, 21:35:26] ~ Ada Ge: yay
[27/12/25, 21:35:34] ~ Ada Ge: you're organizing?
[27/12/25, 21:35:44] ~ Ada Ge: am i allowed to come 🥺
[27/12/25, 21:35:53] ~ Elma : Yes I’m the founder and I’m hosting the night
[27/12/25, 21:36:05] ~ Elma : Are you a student lovely?
[27/12/25, 21:36:09] ~ Elma : What do u do!!
[27/12/25, 21:36:14] ~ Ada Ge: i can pretend to be a student!
[27/12/25, 21:36:17] ~ Ada Ge: im gapping
[27/12/25, 21:36:24] ~ Ada Ge: i studied at imperial last year
[27/12/25, 21:37:18] ~ Elma : I’ve only received this feedback from you but will definitely refine messaging to mitigate confusion.

Our pipeline of clients would deff flag this to me if it was the case they’re v straight forward and professional ppl lol
[27/12/25, 21:37:34] ~ Elma : Ahahaha
[27/12/25, 21:37:55] ~ Elma : Yeee just come it’ll be good fun I’ll drop tickets here when it’s live
[27/12/25, 21:38:04] ~ Elma : Ah that’s sick
[27/12/25, 21:38:13] ~ Ada Ge: you study currently?
[27/12/25, 21:38:25] ~ Elma : No I’m full time on the business
[27/12/25, 21:38:41] ~ Ada Ge: "the business" impressive
[27/12/25, 21:38:43] ~ Elma : I worked in consulting/AI tech startup space for around 3 years
[27/12/25, 21:39:25] ~ Elma : It’s impossible balancing ur own startup and a career in those 2 spaces above^ worked till 10/11 most days so my only decision was to go all in now or never
[27/12/25, 21:39:30] ~ Elma : Thanks queen

[27/12/25, 21:39:47] Haziq KXHL: Yeah of course 😅 sorry I’m really insufferable and have zero filters… pls don’t take me seriously 😭
[27/12/25, 21:39:52] ~ Ada Ge: who are you?
[27/12/25, 21:40:07] ~ manav: you messaged me a while ago about my blog post lol
[27/12/25, 21:40:23] ~ Ada Ge: WHJO ARE YOU
[27/12/25, 21:40:33] ~ Ada Ge: the email guy?
[27/12/25, 21:40:34] ~ Ada Ge: omg
[27/12/25, 21:40:36] ~ Ada Ge: you're him
[27/12/25, 21:40:38] ~ Ada Ge: omg
[27/12/25, 21:40:40] ~ manav: LMFAO
[27/12/25, 21:40:44] ~ Ada Ge: HAHAHHA
[27/12/25, 21:41:05] ~ Ada Ge: that's amazing
[27/12/25, 21:41:18] ~ Ada Ge: so good to meet! cant wait to go to next KXHL
[27/12/25, 21:41:24] Yi Hein: Now I need to know what that blog post is about
[27/12/25, 21:41:35] ~ Elma : Same
[27/12/25, 21:41:39] ~ Ada Ge: it was so good it warranted a reaching out about
[27/12/25, 21:41:48] ~ Ada Ge: i still haven't implemented it tho
[27/12/25, 21:42:03] ~ Ada Ge: but i can see how gmail has the best spam filter compared to everyone else
[27/12/25, 21:42:17] ~ Elma : Loool i hear it I take my work too seriously tbf need to relax sometimes
[27/12/25, 21:42:40] ~ manav: I actually don’t even do this anymore
[27/12/25, 21:42:59] ~ manav: Just pay for fastmail like a schmuck
[27/12/25, 21:43:20] Yi Hein: Share link?
[27/12/25, 21:45:41] ~ Ada Ge: manav i don't have your blog to hand?
[27/12/25, 21:46:49] ~ manav: aaaah stressful
[27/12/25, 21:47:19] ~ manav: i actually redacted the email setup post because the hypocrisy was unbearable
[27/12/25, 21:47:35] ~ manav: https://ponnekanti.net/posts/the-indifference-engine/ you liked this one too though
[27/12/25, 22:35:18] ~ Ada Ge: oh really?
[27/12/25, 22:35:29] ~ Ada Ge: i should do it and have it up on mine
[27/12/25, 22:35:51] ~ Ada Ge: not sure if I've saved it anywhere tho? sad
[27/12/25, 22:36:05] ~ Ada Ge: why did you stop? was it too much effort to maintain
[28/12/25, 03:07:31] ~ manav: idm republishing if it was actually helpful
[28/12/25, 03:08:35] ~ manav: outgoing worked perfectly well, the issue is that cloudflare is unsuccessful at mail forwarding sometimes
[28/12/25, 03:11:15] ~ manav: imo forwarding is not a good solution for load bearing email. i know there’s a service called gomailify that falls back on pop3 periodic fetch if gmail doesn’t like the forwarded email but gmail are deprecating pop3 support anyways. basically google sucks and it’s not worth trying to jank together something that works with their services
[28/12/25, 03:13:31] ~ manav: if i was to rewrite the post now i’d recommend provisioning your own IMAP mailserver on a cheapish VPS and using MXroute as an outbound relay if you really want to be #based or just paying fastmail or proton to handle email for you
[28/12/25, 11:55:59] ~ Ada Ge: mmhm
[28/12/25, 17:44:53] Haziq KXHL: guys guys… fellow neuro / psych colleagues… is it just me or does reading the DSM-5 sometimes feel like staring into a mirror? idk it’s kinda uncanny. anyway histrionic and proud ✌️
[28/12/25, 17:45:51] Haziq KXHL: wait no actually this is bad
[28/12/25, 17:46:10] Haziq KXHL: oh no maladaptive traits but ego-syntonic
[28/12/25, 17:46:50] Haziq KXHL: ego-syntonic + low motivation to change is the real red flag actually
[28/12/25, 17:47:09] Haziq KXHL: this is no longer a joke i fear
[28/12/25, 17:47:30] Haziq KXHL: see you all in the appendix of the DSM-6 👋
[28/12/25, 20:34:08] Haziq KXHL: @⁨~manav⁩ bro I’m reading through that anthropic principle article you linked, some impressions...
(apologies if this is crossfire and not even your view)
[28/12/25, 20:34:38] ~ manav: Yeah i think it’s pretty ridiculous
[28/12/25, 20:34:52] Haziq KXHL: not even gonna get into whether SIA actually has the epistemic force they say it does or whether they can define “mind” without disappearing into a Wittgenstein fly-in-a-bottle situation. those debates never end...
[28/12/25, 20:35:38] Haziq KXHL: but r.e. internal consistency: the author’s move seems to be “even inflationary cosmology only gives you a countable infinity of minds, whereas Big G can give you beth-1, beth-2, etc”
[28/12/25, 20:36:03] ~ manav: On a basic level I think you have to be totally fucked in the head to reason your entire ontology backwards from needing Bayesian conditionalisation to be true
[28/12/25, 20:36:53] Haziq KXHL: ok fine... but that’s assuming those larger infinities of minds are actual or instantiated (where? how? show me pls!!) rather than just mathematically describable
[28/12/25, 20:36:56] ~ manav: Like why SIA vs just admitting that even our precious bayes theorem is subject to incompleteness problems
[28/12/25, 20:37:07] ~ manav: So I’m not gonna disagree with anything you’re saying
[28/12/25, 20:37:16] ~ manav: I just thought it was contextually funny
[28/12/25, 20:37:33] ~ manav: Given the “if EA unbounded utility function, why not church” thing you were saying
[28/12/25, 20:39:24] Haziq KXHL: ngl I was kind of wishing you would push back so I could see if there’s an actual coherent defense I’m missing
[28/12/25, 20:39:29] Haziq KXHL: LOL
[28/12/25, 20:40:06] Haziq KXHL: feels like set theory getting imported straight into ontology and then treated as evidence
[28/12/25, 20:40:06] ~ manav: Ok wait I’ll let you cook
[28/12/25, 20:41:30] Haziq KXHL: funny how EA folks end up having to make God out of math because they needed a reason for maximal goodness like they literally recreate Big G in the image of an effective altruist 😑
[28/12/25, 20:41:46] ~ manav: To steelman their bs, aren’t minds in principle not empirically apt? If there were to be a gorillion minds out psychophysically distributed by a non-measurable metaphysical law then you’d only be able to infer it from this stuff ‎<This message was edited>
[28/12/25, 20:43:27] Haziq KXHL: yeah but if they wanna go that route then literally any non-falsifiable claim is on the table... you can always say “it’s metaphysical so you can only infer it indirectly”
[28/12/25, 20:43:45] ~ manav: Yeah but they infer it statistically ..!
[28/12/25, 20:44:29] ~ manav: Fwiw I think the actual problem is the wittgensteinian fly in the bottle one
[28/12/25, 20:45:25] ~ manav: I think neuroscience needs to decompose the concept of “consciousness” into “awareness” and “mind” as 2 separate phenomena but that’s a whole other conversation
[28/12/25, 20:48:13] Haziq KXHL: hmm what is the “statistics” here supposed to be if there are no empirical hooks or data
it feels like all the work is being done by
choice of reference class
choice of anthropic rule (SIA vs SSA)
assumptions about what God would do
[28/12/25, 20:49:24] Haziq KXHL: so their statistical model is basically “theory confirmed by vibes”
[28/12/25, 20:50:30] Haziq KXHL: especially annoying cos we already have a pretty solid scientific account of altruism via multilevel / multiscale evolutionary models (see Martin Nowak et al.)
[28/12/25, 20:51:29] ~ manav: Tbh I really feel filtered by this kind of analytic philosophy of religion. The arguments themselves don’t make sense to me so it makes me feel better that you also don’t like
[28/12/25, 20:52:02] ~ manav: Wait but why does a scientific account of a behaviour contribute any moral valence to it
[28/12/25, 20:55:10] Haziq KXHL: exactly what I was gonna follow up on lol, yes those models explain how altruism evolves under a neo-Wallacean adaptationist framework but that by itself gives zero moral valence
[28/12/25, 20:55:33] Haziq KXHL: and tbh that’s probably why Nowak himself is an outspoken Christian even though he literally helped build the math here
[28/12/25, 20:56:15] Haziq KXHL: because as you’re saying showing that humans have an evolved bias toward altruism doesn’t answer why you or I as self-aware rational agents who know about those biases ought to be moral rather than exploitative and strategically optimal
[28/12/25, 20:59:48] Haziq KXHL: yeah same tbh, I think I’m more sympathetic to foundationalist approaches
[28/12/25, 21:01:57] Haziq KXHL: like sure the contention is that any metaphysical claim without empirical consequences could be taken as “foundational”... but just the minimal set of background beliefs you need to even make sense of the world and actually live, eat, plan, trust induction, trust other minds etc
[28/12/25, 21:05:36] Haziq KXHL: maybe for some people that minimal “works well enough to live” foundation just does include God
like once you pull it out, other stuff collapses, moral valence, meaning, reasons not to just optimise selfishly, etc
[28/12/25, 21:08:28] Haziq KXHL: the spiciest example is Tolstoy in _A Confession_ where he straight up says that without God there’s no point to living but he also can’t honestly believe
he literally tried to unalive himself IRL, this actually happened
[28/12/25, 21:09:13] Haziq KXHL: he’s not even doing apologetics there, he’s just reporting that his worldview stopped being liveable once certain foundations disappeared
[28/12/25, 21:55:45] Haziq KXHL: what i'd acc ask those people is: if God is only doing work as a theoretical generator of conclusions you already like... why not just keep the conclusions (moral realism / meaning / normativity / induction) as foundations and drop the generator
like why didn’t tolstoy just make “to live” his foundation
[28/12/25, 22:00:49] Haziq KXHL: idk bro i kinda feel bad just poking holes from the safety of not asserting any worldview of my own lol but like… fresher here, gimme a break i barely solved laundry let alone the universe
conflict of interest disclosure: no dog in this fight, my sole foundational commitment is EA hatred
[28/12/25, 22:10:05] ~ manav: I have opinions on this but feels way too off topic
[28/12/25, 22:13:09] ~ manav: Ig suffice to say that I think there are good reasons to pursue foundationalism on its own virtues as opposed to just to bootstrap moral intuitions, aesthetics, causal closure of the empirical domain
[28/12/25, 22:17:03] Haziq KXHL: ur breaking my heart here, i’d pay good money to read that. pls write about it on your blog someday
[28/12/25, 22:17:22] ~ manav: i will happily dm you about it
[28/12/25, 23:07:14] ~ Ada Ge: i would also like to read this
[29/12/25, 01:03:46] ~ Keanu: many moons ago I setup hmailserver but deliverability with outlook/hotmail emails was always a pain (I was running my own online Roblox clone site at the time).. I only pay proton £20/yr with student discount for a custom domain with catchall email, never had any problems and hella less hassle than doing it myself
[29/12/25, 01:06:06] ~ Keanu: my catchall email has come in hella clutch for getting half price off of most northern train tickets 😉 guide: https://youtu.be/QF0_C59GIOQ

[29/12/25, 11:41:14] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: …and at the Eiffel Tower that is too 😂
[29/12/25, 12:52:29] Haziq KXHL: fyi since this is such a psych major joke, rorschach tests are those inkblot things where you project your feelings. so the joke is that im projecting my fear of being left out. pls laugh retroactively 😭🙏
[29/12/25, 12:55:13] Haziq KXHL: im unfortunately taking some psych modules so expect more brainrot
[29/12/25, 13:17:10] Haziq KXHL: bro just revealed his subconscious by interpreting it as the eiffel tower. rorschach is a trap, dont bite ☠️
[29/12/25, 15:40:15] Haziq KXHL: random thought but ive been seeing some takes about the questionable primitives of computational neuroscience lately. no idea where thats coming from.
[29/12/25, 15:40:24] Haziq KXHL: @⁨~manav⁩ what do you think bro
[29/12/25, 16:16:15] ~ Suhas: https://www.slowboring.com/p/lets-all-practice-billionaire-positivity
[29/12/25, 16:16:37] ~ manav: Lmfao thanks for the setup I’ll respond once I’m home
[29/12/25, 17:55:18] Haziq KXHL: ah yes the classic enemy of socialism. the paywall
‎[29/12/25, 17:57:24] Haziq KXHL: ‎image omitted
[29/12/25, 17:57:33] Haziq KXHL: xkcd spin-off lollll
[29/12/25, 18:10:06] ~ Ada Ge: have not figured out a way around the substack paywall. what level is it coded in! goddamn
[29/12/25, 18:12:59] ~ Suhas: You just can't get around it right. Normal paywall bypass is because sites want to be indexed by search engines or archive sites or whatever. With substack there isn't any of that so the information just isn't sent client side.
[29/12/25, 18:14:07] Haziq KXHL: every day, a billionaire goes unheard. for just one take a day, you too can help amplify the voices of the ultra wealthy. please donate your thinkpieces now
[29/12/25, 18:14:44] Haziq KXHL: while many focus on inequality, a brave few ask the harder question. what about the billionaires feelings
[29/12/25, 18:14:59] Haziq KXHL: the hero arc no one asked for 😑
[29/12/25, 18:17:33] Haziq KXHL: but i rate it tho fr. still better than the time ya'll raised money for shrimp anaesthesia. legendary Effective Altruism behaviour ‎<This message was edited>
[29/12/25, 18:22:23] ~ Ada Ge: why is shrimp anaesthesia bad 😭 do you not care about all of gods living creatures on our land and oceans?
[29/12/25, 18:48:30] Haziq KXHL: ...
[29/12/25, 18:49:10] Haziq KXHL: (confusion)
[29/12/25, 18:49:22] Haziq KXHL: (re-reads message)
[29/12/25, 18:49:35] Haziq KXHL: (blinks slowly)
[29/12/25, 18:49:46] Haziq KXHL: (staring at a wall)
[29/12/25, 18:49:55] Haziq KXHL: (pinches myself)
[29/12/25, 18:50:17] Haziq KXHL: i acc thought shrimp anaesthesia was a bit. like surely a bit. turns out its real
[29/12/25, 18:50:35] ~ Suhas: the moral circle expands
[29/12/25, 18:51:29] Haziq KXHL: no comments. just observations
[29/12/25, 18:52:21] Haziq KXHL: 👀 anyone who told me “EA are actually quite similar to you” pls take notes
[29/12/25, 18:55:21] Haziq KXHL: ok i admit we all cried at lion king and bambi at some point but like… i just didnt expect this to be the sequel
[29/12/25, 18:57:43] ~ manav: Why is caring about it bad
[29/12/25, 19:01:01] Haziq KXHL: again no comment on whether it’s good or bad. but a lot of people in this gc are EA-curious. if this is where it ends up, they’ll probably rethink that
[29/12/25, 19:01:26] Haziq KXHL: this is functioning as a subjective reductio ad absurdum for a few people here
[29/12/25, 19:02:55] Haziq KXHL: so is this meant to be a basic belief in the foundationalist sense or something you derive from the theology you’ve constructed (big-G the effective altruist)?
[29/12/25, 19:08:57] Haziq KXHL: coming from a bio background this reminded of fisher’s runaway process. initially grounded in survival value then via a feedback loop keeps evolving toward increasingly arbitrary preferences. EA is the peacock feathers of morality
[29/12/25, 19:11:46] ~ manav: I’m not an effective altruist per se and I still think it’s morally salient
[29/12/25, 19:13:05] ~ manav: It’s a reductio in your own axiology perhaps
[29/12/25, 19:25:32] ~ Ada Ge: no haha i just like phrasing things that way
[29/12/25, 19:25:46] ~ Ada Ge: i think ethics comes from coordination needs and changes based on environment
[29/12/25, 19:25:56] ~ manav: Surely you hold some moral preferences that don’t directly increase your/your genes’/your ingroup’s survival benefit
[29/12/25, 19:26:31] ~ Ada Ge: when I take a step away from that I think that suffering obviously feels bad for each being and is quantitative so straightforwardly i probably want to reduce as much as I can
[29/12/25, 19:26:45] ~ Ada Ge: ya
[29/12/25, 19:27:01] ~ Ada Ge: my disposable income ethics is a runaway process
[29/12/25, 19:27:03] ~ Ada Ge: HI NIV
[29/12/25, 19:27:47] ~ Ada Ge: also, shrimp are funny and contrarian, and im kind of enjoying trolling for the bit
[29/12/25, 19:38:51] ~ manav: Ok so I think this is very related to the “merits of foundationalism” thing. Is it fair to say that the majority of compneuro people are either tacitly or explicitly eliminative materialists
[29/12/25, 19:47:25] Haziq KXHL: oh no i defo didn’t mean to ground moral valence in natural selection. not making a normative claim. just noting the mathematical structure is similar. same feedback dynamics but swap out aesthetic preference for moral preference and mate choice for rich kids whims. analogy not ontology
[29/12/25, 19:54:09] Haziq KXHL: shrimp anaesthesia is your prerogative fr. i just feel like if you’d opened with “we’re advocating for shrimp” i would’ve calibrated differently instead of engaging in good faith 😭
[29/12/25, 19:56:13] ~ manav: Ok to be clear I’ve never engaged in any shrimp anaesthesia-related activities or causes for better or for worse
[29/12/25, 19:57:33] Haziq KXHL: lol sorry cross-fire, was speaking to the EA folks
[29/12/25, 19:58:25] ~ manav: But I find it hard to disavow the idea that it would be good to give shrimp almost-free eugenol before chopping off their eye stalks or whatever people do with them
[29/12/25, 19:59:27] Haziq KXHL: ok just to show solidarity
https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/donate

while the world focuses on war and poverty, a quiet crisis unfolds beneath the waves
somewhere right now, a shrimp is feeling pain. and you could have stopped it
they said it was too small to matter. they were wrong
please donate. not for yourself. not for us. for the shrimp
[29/12/25, 20:00:03] ~ manav: What’s wrong with insignificant moral goods
[29/12/25, 20:00:58] ~ manav: It’s pretty obvious to me that war and poverty are orders of magnitude more important but that doesn’t polarise me into gunning for shrimp torture
[29/12/25, 20:03:13] ~ manav: I also don’t buy the implicit idea that people are extinguishing a finite supply of moral concern on these relatively marginal issues because it’s actually more likely to me that someone who cares about suffering this marginal is going to agree with me about the suffering of _outgroup humans_
[29/12/25, 20:03:33] Haziq KXHL: "war and poverty are orders of magnitude more important"
well that’s because you’re not an effective altruist. also if it’s basically free why are we fundraising for it bro 😭
[29/12/25, 20:05:16] ~ manav: I agree that unbounded utility functions lead people to weird places but considering that people are moral for extremely heterogenous reasons I’m contented to seek consensus morality. Caring how they get there feels like a luxury belief in our “America for heritage Americans” world
[29/12/25, 20:08:07] ~ manav: Most people (maybe all, not sure) are functionally emotivists. Intuition pumps work because people are just trying to find a lossy logic that map onto their intuitions in the first place
[29/12/25, 20:09:16] ~ Amelie: 1 billion shrimp vs 1 human life
[29/12/25, 20:09:17] ~ manav: A Real Utilitarian ™️ would just bite the bullet on the repugnant conclusion or whatever else instead of systematising around it
[29/12/25, 20:09:30] ~ Amelie: who do you save?
[29/12/25, 20:10:16] ~ manav: Would you boil a billion babies to save a trillion lives ahh question
[29/12/25, 20:10:58] ~ Amelie: Surely there’s some threshold at which shrimp suffering would matter more to you though
[29/12/25, 20:12:02] ~ manav: I don’t have a good answer to this question because my moral intuitions are sized to my individual agency and I don’t trust that they extrapolate linearly
[29/12/25, 20:12:29] Haziq KXHL: hiiii amelie!!! sorry bad timing for admin housekeeping ik 😭 but tysm for chiming in esp at such an interesting moment lolll. hope you’re enjoying the season and also our forum!!! would love to see you at our next in-person hack sesh on the 7th!! also feel free to drop an intro if we haven’t met yet 😊
[29/12/25, 20:14:09] Haziq KXHL: yeah im actually inclined to agree with you that moral concern shouldn’t be treated as finite. a lot of my own volunteering gets labelled “sub-optimal” by these folks anyway.

but my point is more that since EA is so committed to preaching its worldview with a dedication only rivalled by the church of LDS, maybe they should just present a clear welcome bouquet of what falls out of their utility-function reasoning.

like just lay it all out upfront so people can decide whether they vibe with it or not.

said bouquet could include
* shrimp anaesthesia
* western lives being implicitly more valuable because “counterfactual impact”
* “well if he died poor in africa what could he realistically have done anyway”
* caring more about hypothetical future beings than existing inconvenient humans
* and more!!
[29/12/25, 20:14:16] ~ manav: I just don’t buy the underlying axiom, i.e. that doing felicific calculus for problems like this yields something that’s truth-apt
[29/12/25, 20:14:31] ~ manav: Like I could reply either way to that question and I don’t think it would be a truth claim
[29/12/25, 20:14:34] ~ Amelie: Oo cool, I might do as i’m in london for morph house
[29/12/25, 20:14:59] ~ Amelie: What’s a better alternative?
[29/12/25, 20:15:17] ~ Amelie: Do you think there needs to be an alternative to pure emotivism in the first place?
[29/12/25, 20:18:37] ~ manav: Well I think there are lots of moral emotivists who do good so in that sense it’s prima facie untrue
[29/12/25, 20:18:45] ~ manav: That there needs to be an alternative
[29/12/25, 20:19:21] ~ manav: I’m personally a foundationalist but that resolves metaphysically upstream for me
[29/12/25, 20:19:48] Haziq KXHL: woww that’s so cool!! what are you cooking up at morph house anyway 👀 is it all very hush hush or something lol
[29/12/25, 20:22:07] Samuel KXHL: Which way would you reply though?
[29/12/25, 20:22:47] Samuel KXHL: It can still be a truth claim about what matters to you, even if it's not a truth about what someone objectively ought to care about ‎<This message was edited>
[29/12/25, 20:23:12] ~ manav: I.e. I endorse something like a Platonic ontic good but am not confident in our ability to know it exactly. I think some amount of consequentialism is very useful in making our own intuitions legible to ourselves. Ultimately I’d say I’m closest to something like MacIntyre’s revived virtue ethics
[29/12/25, 20:24:11] ~ Amelie: I don’t think so
[29/12/25, 20:24:55] ~ Amelie: I’m not in the loop though, on the bus there rn
[29/12/25, 20:25:50] ~ manav: I think it’s definitionally not a truth claim because it’s not propositional
[29/12/25, 20:26:19] ~ manav: But idk
[29/12/25, 20:26:27] Samuel KXHL: Wait "S cares more about the lives of a billion shrimp than of one human" is a proposition
[29/12/25, 20:26:46] Samuel KXHL: Or "S would choose to save the live of one human over a billion shrimp"
[29/12/25, 20:26:59] ~ manav: Yes, “it is true that manav holds x attitude” is a proposition
[29/12/25, 20:27:07] ~ manav: But the attitude itself is non-propositional
[29/12/25, 20:27:17] ~ manav: So why does it matter
[29/12/25, 20:27:26] Samuel KXHL: I'm curious what attitude you hold
[29/12/25, 20:28:56] Samuel KXHL: I think it matters because there are both logical and pragmatic constraints on what attitudes you can hold together
[29/12/25, 20:29:11] Samuel KXHL: You can't simultaneously hold the attitude that X is better than Y and Y is better than X
[29/12/25, 20:29:42] Samuel KXHL: And if you have the attitude that X is better than Y and Y is better than Z and Z is better than X then you can be money pumped
[29/12/25, 20:33:00] ~ manav: Some part of me seems to hold the phenomenology of suffering to be intrinsically bound up with the complexity of the mental states sustained by the agent in question, and this part of me seems to think that the complexity of shrimp is such that no number of them could accumulate as much phenomenological suffering as a single human being. But another part of me finds this stupid and indefensible because internal states are enclosed which renders the first assumption unfalsifiable ‎<This message was edited>
[29/12/25, 20:33:28] ~ manav: Also is suffering even bound up with complexity in any meaningful way? Bentham cries
[29/12/25, 20:35:55] ~ manav: So my non propositional attitude is IDK but I can minimally hold that simple life forms can hold moral value, even if it’s a trivial quantity
[29/12/25, 20:42:11] ~ manav: I actually disagree with this. You can talk about the internal coherence of whatever logic is used to resolve moral intuitions relative to one another but the reality is that someone’s answer to some random big number moral dilemma question is going to rely on some random ad hoc reasoning which will either not generalise with whatever logic they use to resolve ordinary moral situations or resolve in a very tortuous way
[29/12/25, 20:43:23] ~ Ada Ge: I'm going to donate money to shrimp right now
[29/12/25, 20:43:51] Haziq KXHL: ok im gonna quietly step away from this debate bc i don’t actually have normative moral claims of my own and i don’t wanna be the nitpicking jerk. my epistemology is vibes-based moving-target foundationalism with some explicit anti-rationalism mixed in, i decline to supply axioms on principle.

i also have a mildly joker-from-batman attitude to this stuff. treating ethical frameworks as performative and using absurdity as a stress test rather than something im personally committed to.

im honestly just observing this like ethology, watching reactions. this is all for the audience, not for myself.

but as a quick diagnostic to make sure im still in baseline reality: if you think the radical heresy “donating to shrimp anaesthesia (be it one or gazillion) isn’t the best use of marginal dollars” is at least plausible, pls react 👍 so i know this isn’t a LessWrong comment section LOL
[29/12/25, 20:44:33] Haziq KXHL: but also this is exactly why we run kxhl. pls keep cooking guys this is fantastic
[29/12/25, 20:44:36] ~ Ada Ge: it's not plausible because of the effect of land use on soil insects but i'll ignore that for now
[29/12/25, 20:45:34] ~ manav: IMO it’s actually the other way around. Showing someone internal incoherence with upstream moral attitudes they also possess is a good way of shifting their moral intuitions precisely because they also possess an intuition that parsimony is good
[29/12/25, 20:47:26] ~ manav: I don’t disagree with the money pumping point though
[29/12/25, 20:47:44] ~ manav: Only that it applies to absurd hypotheticals
[29/12/25, 20:48:25] ~ manav: Someone who demonstrates large inconsistencies in human sized moral judgements doesn’t value parsimony or have the capacity to consider it so is probably an irrational decision maker
‎[29/12/25, 20:50:10] ~ Ada Ge: online friends doing a fundraiser. I think some of this goes to SWP, the rest to chickens and fish. feel free to support! ‎image omitted
[29/12/25, 20:50:24] ~ Ada Ge: https://x.com/i/status/2002441513972977860
‎[29/12/25, 20:51:25] Haziq KXHL: final note: if you look at this and go oh no those poor shrimp, your feelings are valid and i support you 🤥 ‎image omitted
[29/12/25, 20:55:25] Haziq KXHL: not to hijack but i fear my histrionic personality disorder compels me to... some causes we support at the women’s health soc:
https://forgottenwomen.org/
https://www.thecycle.world/
support if you’re able. after the shrimp. always after the shrimp 🦐🤝
[29/12/25, 22:26:29] Haziq KXHL: whew 😌 feels like the dust has settled

just wanted to say you guys are genuinely incredible. like once in a generation vibes istg. from day one KXHL has reminded me of the martian era (with von neumann, pólya, erdős etc.). just an insane convergence of sharp, curious people all in one place, arguing, building & learning in public

im learning so much from everyone here especially bc we don’t all agree and we’re not trying to. that’s exactly why this space works and why it’ll never become an echo chamber

we’ll pick up the comp neuro and foundationalism threads when everyone has more energy and sleep for sure

really grateful for this group. this is special 💛
[29/12/25, 22:33:30] Haziq KXHL: lil story time actually. met these guys last halloween. i was on my way to an improv sesh with a full arsenal of ghost jokes locked and loaded, saw yi hein outside print room cafe holding the iconic banner, started talking, lost track of time, missed improv completely and have not known peace since ✌️
[29/12/25, 22:38:08] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Your autobiography will be sick! 💯😂
[29/12/25, 22:38:25] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Sorry folks sooo much work didn’t get to read anything above 😭
[29/12/25, 22:39:35] Haziq KXHL: also since it’s still festive season, casual updates are very welcome. honestly always welcome. pls chime in occasionally as a turing test bc im starting to suspect some of you might be machines

also yes *saffron & pistachio macarons* are in the oven along with *focaccia* thank u for asking. fyi im from india so rose saffron pistachio is literally my culinary canon
[29/12/25, 22:40:25] Haziq KXHL: it’s actually just this gc bound in hardcover 😭
[29/12/25, 22:40:52] Haziq KXHL: you chose peace 🙏
[29/12/25, 23:32:52] Yi Hein: Hey everyone, our next session will be this *Friday*, 5.30pm, 2nd Jan at Kings Cross, followed by a social at 7pm.

https://luma.com/naivb9wk

Pancras Square Library 
5 Pancras Square
N1C 4AG

see you there!
[30/12/25, 00:09:57] ~ Keanu: archive.ph is goated for getting around 99% of paywalls whenever I want to read the torygraph or some other random news sites
[30/12/25, 00:17:09] Haziq KXHL: bro casually drops how to bypass 99% of paywalls. also tells us how to hack northern rail for 50% off. neo is that you?? keanu reeves fr??
[30/12/25, 07:09:21] ~ Carmen : Hey everyone! 👋 I'm new here and interested in joining the meet-up on the 2nd. Just curious, do people typically bring laptops and work on projects together at the library?

I should mention I'm more an artist who works with tech than a traditional programmer. I'm exploring creative coding, also interested in Arduino. I hope that fits ☺️ 
Carmen ‎<This message was edited>
[30/12/25, 08:50:37] Haziq KXHL: hiiiiii Carmen!!! so good to have you here & rlly excited to see you at our Friday sesh 🔥

r.e. laptops / working on projects... totally up to you tbh. some ppl do deep work sessions (coding, problem sets, etc.), others are fighting cats and dogs over some philosophical edge case and others are just here to spectate the chaos bc ngl it’s iconic

also soooo cool that you’re an artist btw. would love to see your work. bring a canvas paintbrushes arduino whatever works

very much a do your own thing space so you’ll fit right in ✌️
[30/12/25, 08:58:26] Haziq KXHL: https://kxhacklab.com/
also check out the website when you get a sec - it makes it super clear that artists, designers, tinkerers etc are very much part of the kxhl vibe. tbh the only underrepresented demographic is me and my bio / psych arc lol but we ball
[30/12/25, 09:03:42] Haziq KXHL: our motto is: where ideas become real every wednesday (on friday)
[30/12/25, 09:04:08] Haziq KXHL: sorry @⁨Yi Hein⁩ read too much foucault and now i must be critical of the institution im part of
[30/12/25, 09:13:39] ~ Carmen : That sounds great! :) Thank you
[30/12/25, 10:45:48] Haziq KXHL: r.e. last night’s discussion, while i don’t take first-order moral stances, i do want to flag a political question. if a moral framework is (a) deeply unintuitive or outright repugnant to most people (99.999999% mind you!) and (b) disproportionately enacted by elites with outsized power over NGOs, academia, policy and public discourse, is “it’s my money” actually defensible? at scale this stops being private charity and starts looking like private governance especially once you factor in very literal lobbying, capture and corruption a la Peter Thiel where wealth is used to bypass democratic or social consent entirely. most people never agreed to utilitarian optimisation, future-being prioritisation or counterfactual impact logic yet those assumptions increasingly shape what gets funded studied and legitimised.
[30/12/25, 10:46:15] Haziq KXHL: like a rich kid clutching their pearls going “daddy the shrimp!!” while daddy is actively funding coups, deregulation and the end of democracy
[30/12/25, 10:52:36] Haziq KXHL: https://youtu.be/VNbIKtGMoaA?si=US6RNOUle5VG5hXm

just so everyone can touch grass for a second. this is the public’s attitude. by which i mean actual poor, working class, middle class people, the same people the state is allegedly designed to serve. these are people being crushed by a cost of living crisis to the point that this season is a very well known suicide spike if you’ve ever used national rail or worked with Samaritans (yes ik correlation isn’t causation, take it as anecdotal evidence from the other side of the phone i.e. listening volunteer).

to these people, a government or public policy apparatus even gesturing toward this kind of prioritisation would register as a near-unforgivable betrayal. if that feels surprising to you, it’s because you clearly haven’t met them in a long time ‎<This message was edited>
[30/12/25, 11:00:54] Haziq KXHL: but ofc i’m neutral here so in the spirit of solidarity i’m very happy to give shrimp anaesthesia a quick plug on a suicide helpline, maybe stick a few posters up in homeless shelters, heck we could even airdrop some over a warzone while we’re at it. why not add a little sticker to malaria injections too, gently reminding recipients that they are in fact prioritising their own individual survival over the collective welfare of all sentient beings incl shrimp insects and future brains in vats. perhaps they’ll see the light and unilaterally refuse aid or better yet demand it be redirected to these more optimal causes. that would be the consistent move after all
[30/12/25, 11:10:54] ~ Ada Ge: this is good. this is inflammatory but also good
[30/12/25, 11:13:36] ~ Ada Ge: i would like to propose a) your morals are noisy but shift to becoming more analytical the richer the nation you belong to, because analytical morals and institutions (if they are not immediately punished) indeed (in the long run) create richer nations
[30/12/25, 11:14:33] ~ Ada Ge: and analytical triage is where EA is coming from SPECIFICALLY if you have lots of slack time, wealth, education to pursue it
[30/12/25, 11:18:37] ~ Ada Ge: it's not fair that Derek Parfit or Immanual Kant or the Buddha were mostly born into wealth, so they didn't have to do manual work but instead write their treatises. It's also not fair that most EAs are better off than the public. But it's ALSO not fair that all of us are in the top 10% of humans in the world by wealth and that's closely correlated with QOL, objectively speaking, PPP adjusted. https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/how-rich-am-i
[30/12/25, 11:23:23] ~ Ada Ge: I think then giving to make people I see on the street happy or people who call me on the hotline happier is being stuck in a local optima. It's serving who I can see, when I can infer that there are people beyond that who I can't see who are in a worse state
[30/12/25, 11:26:17] ~ Ada Ge: where do you stop? I think a reasonable approach is making a weighted portfolio of far away humans, farmed animals, and wild animals to serve. right now i don't personally think the far future is important and i don't personally think UK people are relatively neglected and unhappy as a group. Of course individuals will be different but if we're operating on heuristics for the sake of being tractable.
[30/12/25, 11:26:55] ~ Ada Ge: and after that at some point I run into the issue of psychologically not being sustainably motivated enough anymore, which is where I stop. ‎<This message was edited>
[30/12/25, 11:28:52] ~ Ada Ge: but I agree with you there should be significantly more money giving humanitarian aid to warzones, and moving some of the unhappiest people out of the unhappiest countries, from EA people. it's an obvious value for money thing.
[30/12/25, 11:36:24] ~ Ada Ge: i think it's perfectly defensible that you stop where you do, but after that we're obviously trying to do different things, i.e. trying to triage more or less across all the welfare issues in the world there all. i think it's good that what you care about is significantly more robust than what EAs care about as a group. i wish they were more like you in what they did tbh. it's hard to say who will be more successful in doing what they set out to in the long run
[30/12/25, 11:39:24] ~ Ada Ge: also both things are not mutually exclusive! volunteering creates more energy than just picking charities and vice versa. you're definitely a better person for volunteering more than me, and in long term equilibrium i should volunteer more, like I should exercise more, it's only a stochastic choice of when do I start each and how early
[30/12/25, 11:40:42] ~ Ada Ge: excited that you're here carmen!!
[30/12/25, 11:49:01] ~ samia 💗🌸: Hi Carmen, I’m bringing my laptop and working on a project . See you next session 🙏🏼
[30/12/25, 12:27:39] ~ Euan Ong: ‎~ Euan Ong joined using a group link.
[30/12/25, 14:40:07] Haziq KXHL: wow tysm @⁨~Ada Ge⁩ for the detailed writeup, much appreciated!! way easier for me to process than all the cross-talk lol. cocktail party effect!! lemme just drop some thoughts and then i’ll scram and let you cook
[30/12/25, 14:43:19] Haziq KXHL: oh no it’s very clear to me that EA is coming from a place of obscene wealth and privilege, i’ve never doubted that for a second. the issue is that my people (working class) simply don’t have the bandwidth to wade through the theories of your people (rich kids™️). but thankfully reasoning from propositions isn’t the only way to evaluate a framework. there’s also reductio ad absurdum, not in a mathematical sense, but conflict with people’s moral intuitions or basic beliefs (in a foundationalist sense). so what i’m trying to do here is make those implications clear so common people can see the mindset of those increasingly in control of the institutions their lives depend on. that said, if you’ve got more spreadsheet math lying around like unbounded utility functions or derivations of Big-G the maker of a cantor-on-LSD number of minds, i’m more than happy to personally evaluate them 🤝
[30/12/25, 14:45:06] Haziq KXHL: ahh but the spreadsheet will eventually disagree with you ada. once the number of shrimp under consideration crosses some morally significant threshold we will of course have to redirect attention away from warzones and human relocation. at sufficient scale shrimp dominate. the math is clear
[30/12/25, 14:48:08] Haziq KXHL: oh but what can those people do for the future brains in vats, won’t someone think of their suffering! and also speaking from a volunteering background and still being plugged into people actually doing the work on the ground, the bleak reality is we’ll “save” someone one day only for them to be killed the next by some senseless indiscriminate attack. and yet we keep fundraising, my friends keep putting their lives at risk for them, very irrational behaviour ik right? 🤷‍♂️ 

so idk if the spreadsheet really thinks that one day of suffering alleviated scores particularly highly. maybe the more optimal move is to focus on making billionaires live to 200 since those guys can definitely do more to reduce overall suffering. spreadsheet approved ✅.
(not a bit btw this is unironically a major EA focus)
[30/12/25, 14:49:11] ~ Ada Ge: "future brains in vats" you're not arguing against my position, someone else's
[30/12/25, 14:49:25] ~ Ada Ge: the math isn't clear
[30/12/25, 14:49:44] ~ Ada Ge: we're still trying to figure out how much insect can feel
[30/12/25, 14:50:53] ~ Ada Ge: if it was clear then i'd let you know
[30/12/25, 14:51:05] Haziq KXHL: also pls don't feel obliged to reply immediately since ik youve got good some very good arguments, ill drop a few more points and be outta here so you explain in detail ‎<This message was edited>
[30/12/25, 14:58:21] Haziq KXHL: lemme push back a bit and say i’m not a “better person” by any stretch. i’m basically a moral cynic. i’m a showman ada. dream of postdoc-ing at disney imagineering to see if perception / psychophysics translates into academy awards for vfx LOL. entirely possible all the volunteering is just me satisfying histrionic tendencies.

but i’m also very consciously playing the arthur fleck role here, creating a bit of disequilibrium so the masks drop and people can actually see what effective altruism cashes out to in practice. and i think that matters because these are the same people architecting the state and institutions the public depends on. think the trolley problem except i’m the trolley.

 the demographic i’m talking about is the majority whose interests a democratic state is meant to serve and for them a gazillion shrimp vs one human is not a dilema, it’s a no-brainer (and yes that means the human, just in case it's still not clear 😵‍💫)
[30/12/25, 14:59:38] Haziq KXHL: to sum up, to shrimp or not to shrimp... i genuinely don’t care. this was never about shrimp for me. this is about the quiet shift from democracy to technocracy and the growing divergence between what a small class of self-appointed optimisers think ought to happen and what actual people want or would ever consent to
[30/12/25, 15:00:01] ~ Ada Ge: you know most elites are not EAs by a long shot, only the weirdest ones are
[30/12/25, 15:00:44] Haziq KXHL: btw ada saying “inflammatory but also good” might be the most generous description of me ever 💛. i usually just get "inflammatory and who let this psycho in the room"
[30/12/25, 15:01:47] Haziq KXHL: also... the post-brunch holiday nap hits different istg. ran into marx in a dream
he asked how adam smith was doing
told him he died centuries ago
marx was like “ah. the invisible hand finally caught him”
LOL
[30/12/25, 15:03:05] Haziq KXHL: okk im officially outta here for a few hours, please feel free to cook 🔥
[30/12/25, 15:07:21] Haziq KXHL: lolll sorry just one last thing… what’re you working on btw? asking earnestly, defo not to turn it into an iconic bit 🤥 pinky promise i won’t be “inflammatory but also good” 🤞
[30/12/25, 17:38:20] ~ manav: Don’t you think it’s a bit sophistic to tag on unbounded utility function + negative utilitarianism + Bayesian felicific calculus to “anaesthetise crustaceans” and then attack those things instead of the proposition itself
[30/12/25, 17:43:55] ~ manav: You say that you don’t defend any first order moral positions but you’ve created a framing wherein we are supposed to pretend that “endless suffering of relatively simple organisms matters less than minor inconvenience to humans” is the baseline moral intuition
[30/12/25, 17:45:05] ~ manav: It pretty obviously isn’t. We have welfare laws for using mice in experiments. Do you think the baseline moral intuition of Joe Public is “fuck that noise let’s repeal them”?
[30/12/25, 17:48:00] ~ manav: Insofar as there’s a reductio at all its to do with complexity thresholds for suffering not this false inference that having a lower complexity threshold forces a shrimp utility monster
[30/12/25, 18:34:15] Haziq KXHL: i have zero problem with 'reduce crustacean suffering if its cheap' as a first order stance, i dont even take sides there
the issue is they're not selling just that, they're selling the whole effective altruism optimisation bundle and im just pointing out the feature creep so people can see what else comes with it
[30/12/25, 18:34:26] Haziq KXHL: the question was democratic legitimacy not animal welfare
those laws exist because people consented to them not because a spreadsheet outvoted them
[30/12/25, 18:36:39] Haziq KXHL: its not about how many elites buy into EA... its about how many people with enough power to bypass democracy do
[30/12/25, 18:42:12] Haziq KXHL: "the math isnt clear" should honestly be the effective altruism motto
past vague intuitions about "doing the most good", your formal systems are patched, fragile and incoherent
if you disagree post your cleanest steelman axioms and lets do an autopsy
[30/12/25, 19:41:20] Haziq KXHL: final point... under EA there is obviously some number of shrimp that outweighs a human life
thats where you lose joe public, joe's mum and joe's dog ‎<This message was edited>
[30/12/25, 19:41:57] Haziq KXHL: since we like math heres one from baby rudin
ε > 0 for shrimp, h < ∞ for a human implies ∃n with nε > h
thats literally the archimedean property
so yes there is always a shrimp threshold
[30/12/25, 19:57:58] ~ manav: So it seems like your actual issue is with EA, which is fine. My point is that this isn’t an effective reductio
[30/12/25, 19:58:56] ~ manav: This in particular, sure! This is a perfectly fine reductio
[30/12/25, 20:00:19] ~ manav: But “if you shake EA, some amount of moral concern for crustaceans falls out” isn’t
[30/12/25, 20:06:14] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Why is electronic arts catching stays here 
For them no amount of shrimps would unlock a dog 😂
[30/12/25, 20:10:55] Haziq KXHL: if your framework implies a number where joe public becomes expendable thats the reductio
[30/12/25, 20:31:19] ~ manav: Absolutely true but I think that holds for a huge number of cause areas
[30/12/25, 20:32:51] Haziq KXHL: yes exactly
thats why those frameworks shouldnt get to steer institutions unilaterally without public consent
[30/12/25, 20:32:56] ~ manav: Including capabilities and alignment
[30/12/25, 20:33:23] ~ manav: No issue with this
[30/12/25, 20:34:08] ~ manav: FWIW 80k hours uses my chosen career as the stock example of misspent utility ‎<This message was edited>
[30/12/25, 20:37:51] Haziq KXHL: you and me both
toast to careers of misspent utility 🍻
[30/12/25, 20:39:09] Haziq KXHL: this is the uncertainty cop out
shrimp suffering has expected value ε with huge uncertainty
as long as E[ε] > 0 and human value H < ∞ you still get ∃n with n·E[ε] > H
uncertainty wont save joe public cos linearity of expectation kills him anyway
[30/12/25, 20:40:22] Haziq KXHL: i have no intention of defending capabilities alignment or any framework at all
im committing moral kamikaze here
ive assumed the position of Camus' Meursault
[30/12/25, 20:40:31] ~ manav: I’ll guess what I’ll say is that most of the EAs I know irl are not so doctrinaire
[30/12/25, 20:41:17] ~ manav: They’re just people who want to do good and are cynical of received norms around doing good so update in the direction of a larger moral circle
[30/12/25, 20:41:30] ~ manav: Which is a good update imo
[30/12/25, 20:42:00] ~ Ada Ge: taking the bait and saying joe public is dumb
[30/12/25, 20:43:02] ~ manav: Sounds like we need to create a Department of Government Efficiency to compensate for Joe Public’s stupidity and the wastefulness of his chosen representatives
[30/12/25, 20:43:54] ~ manav: I will defend the shrimp with you but leave Joe Public alone
[30/12/25, 20:44:46] ~ Ada Ge: agreed
[30/12/25, 20:45:20] ~ manav: I have been dancing around my foundationalist commitments but I fear I won’t be able to much longer
[30/12/25, 20:45:35] ~ Ada Ge: what does that mean?
[30/12/25, 20:46:29] ~ manav: I believe in transcendent goods
[30/12/25, 20:46:48] ~ manav: But not in a thought terminating cliche way .. hopefully
[30/12/25, 20:48:52] ~ Ada Ge: woahhh i see
[30/12/25, 22:58:19] Haziq KXHL: ok i like the direction this is heading. lemme quickly drop a few things and then skedaddle. long study day so ill be back later after midnight if you guys wanna continue.
but honestly sleep is 100% better istg. take care of yourselves, dont be like me
[30/12/25, 23:04:50] Haziq KXHL: at least when they pretend to be doctrinaire, i can pretend to respect it.
otherwise their cynicism is just another arbitrary preference like the norms theyre rejecting.
updates arent one dimensional. morality isnt concentric circles. updates can go in a lot of directions.
this is just taste dressed up as progress. peacock feathers...
*_imo_* is doing all the work here.
when did *_imo_* become enough to enact a new world order under the guise of rationality and optimality. ‎<This message was edited>
[30/12/25, 23:08:07] Haziq KXHL: lets talk about joe.
i dont know how often you meet joe, but joe is my lifeblood so id say i know him a little.
joe is uneducated. joe is poor. joe is tired. joe is bad with abstractions.
joe also thinks _*I*_ (yes me hi) dont belong here. joe hates my existence. joe votes against my interests.
and id still take a bullet for him.
because joe is just trying to survive and get through the week.

saying joe public is dumb is just the just-world phenomenon from social psychology.
its the belief that you deserve to be where you are and joe deserves to be where he is.
when in reality your wealth and leisure to theorise came off joes back,
so they could send their kids to private schools and elite universities,
and come back to preach optimisation, shrimp sympathy, and why joe shouldnt get a vote.

and before anyone projects morals onto this, lemme clarify...
my allegiance to joe is like Arthur Flecks allegiance to gothams public.
no morals here. just anarchism.
[30/12/25, 23:10:24] Haziq KXHL: saying joe is stupid only works if your framework is actually rational.
so let EA grow a spine and present the formal system. lay out the axioms. lets see if it survives mathematical scrutiny.
still waiting on those precious axioms ada.

funny how when you talk to joe its all "we're following the math you just dont get it",
but the moment you step into an applied maths room the math talk evaporates.
sabretooth suddenly turns into a toothless tabby cat.
[30/12/25, 23:14:55] Haziq KXHL: anyway thats me folks till around midnight. catch you later
[31/12/25, 08:38:15] ~ Ada Ge: no I'm not saying the world is just. I obviously don't deserve to be where I am. i don't really believe in a transcendent good like justice except as it shows up in the strength of institution measurements
[31/12/25, 08:51:32] ~ Ada Ge: My bad. im not good enough at math to set utilitarianism on axioms. and I can't speak for most other EAs. though I would like to posit that actions tend to weakly get closer to axioms (or consistency) under 3 AND conditions: the more you have resources to spend (only truly disposable resources can be spent impartially), the more time you read + think for yourself, and the more you care, and I definitely lucked out to be able to do more of this than Joe (the first two, we're no different on the last one). You can counter reading and understanding verbal arguments this is at the expense of seeing the world with my own eyes, but I don't think that's true, I'd think of books and others' arguments as tools like telescopes and microscopes that only show me more of what's out there. Having this privilege is none of my doing. But once I have it now i only try to serve the most underserved
[31/12/25, 08:57:37] ~ Ada Ge: i used to believe in axioms but now I only believe in taste. which kind of unfortunately rests on chosen parts of other people's axioms and intuitions. but which the citation graph is implicit and needs to be traced to be made concrete
[31/12/25, 08:57:59] ~ Ada Ge: (which I'm interested in as an area of research! but I don't know of a good way to do that yet?)
[31/12/25, 09:02:26] ~ Ada Ge: use mechinterp techniques or something!
[31/12/25, 09:59:56] Yi Hein: 🎉 KXHL WRAPPED 2025 🎉

As we close out the year where we accidentally built a socialist hack club inside a capitalist institution, here is the official (unhinged) review of Kings Cross Hack Lab 2025.

📊 The Vitals

Total Lines of Code Written: 40% Python, 60% "Claude please fix this."

Tables Conquered: The Print Room Cafe staff are terrified of us. We have squatted in the Refractory, Pancras Square Library, the Google Office (outside on the cold concrete), and the National Gallery (building GPT-2 in front of fine art).

Most Used Phrases: "Vibe coding," "I’m running 15 mins late," "Is this matchmaking?", "Free Energy Principle."

Primary Fuel: Pret subscription, Haziq’s hypothetical baked goods, and pure, unfiltered impostor syndrome.

🏆 The 2025 Superlatives

👑 The "AGI is Just Around the Corner" Award: @Yi Hein For trying to solve scientific discovery via LLMs while simultaneously struggling to book a room at UCL. Currently optimizing his life for "laziness" via high-dimensional latent spaces.

📣 The "Chief Yapper / Resident Marxist" Award: @⁨Haziq KXHL⁩ For delivering 3:30 AM sermons on Žižek, fighting Effective Altruists, and gaslighting us about bake sales. Status: Still waiting for that milk cake.

🛠️ The "Hardware & Archives" Award: @⁨Niv Ucl Builder⁩ For bringing biosensors to the pub, reading dictionaries from 1796, and being the only person who actually knows how Linux works.

💼 The "Billable Hours" Award: @⁨~samia 💗🌸⁩ For participating in high-level panels, being a "consultant," and knitting one (1) jumper arm. Time of arrival: T-minus 15 minutes.

🚫 The "Definitely NOT a Matchmaker" Award: @⁨~Elma ⁩ Founder of Apprentice Living. It is housing. It is events. It is absolutely, categorically, legally not Hinge. (But nice try, Haziq).

🦐 The "Moral Dilemma" Award: @⁨~Ada Ge⁩ & @⁨~manav⁩ & @⁨Samuel KXHL⁩ For derailing the entire chat on December 29th with the Shrimp Welfare vs. Foundationalism debate. The most "KXHL" moment of the year.

📈 The "Market Maker" Award: @⁨~Tuhan Sapumanage⁩ & @⁨~Suhas⁩ For providing the capitalist reality check to our socialist delusions and reminding us that someone has to pay for the GPUs.

🌟 Core Memories Unlocked

The FEP Wars: We still don't know if the Free Energy Principle is real or just a vibe, but we have written enough paragraphs about it to publish a thesis.

The National Gallery Hack: Because nothing says "disruptive tech" like coding neural nets next to 17th-century oil paintings.

The Bake Sale That Wasn't: A saga of phantom brownies and doctors' strikes.

The "Eiffel Tower" Rorschach Test: We saw a tower; Haziq saw deep psychological trauma. Standard Tuesday.

🔮 Predictions for 2026

Yi Hein finally releases the "Makemore" model that names everyone's firstborn child.

Haziq actually brings a cake to a session (betting markets are open on Manifold).

We finally get kicked out of the Print Room Cafe.

We solve consciousness (or at least figure out how to bypass the Substack paywall).

Happy New Year, builders. Go touch some grass (or snow) before we lock in again this Friday.
[31/12/25, 10:47:04] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Haha the best wrapped of 2025!!! 😂😂😍
[31/12/25, 10:51:51] Haziq KXHL: wow new year honours already??
was really hoping for gen z james dean but resident marxist will do i guess
[31/12/25, 12:00:11] Haziq KXHL: ok time to earn that title 
(as always no need for live replies, pls take your time, discussion has more depth that way)
[31/12/25, 12:02:07] Haziq KXHL: if justice only exists where institutions can measure it then institutions are just by definition 🐍
read foucault for goodness sake
saying you don’t deserve to be here while still wanting the levers isn’t humility and i’m not sure why your taste outranks joe’s
[31/12/25, 12:05:23] Haziq KXHL: ok let me break down this word soup for the audience because i think joe public has a right to understand what this esoteric vocabulary is actually doing

you’re saying there exists something like moral consistency or axioms even if we can’t specify it and that human actions tend to move closer to it when certain elite conditions are met

this is the kind of thing that makes the math part of my brain itch. converge with respect to what function. none is given. in math there is no convergence without topology, metric and target.

basically you’re asking us to accept that surplus, leisure and elite discourse are truth-tracking for morality even tho you’ve explicitly refused to say what the truth is

feels so familiar. it’s the same structure as modern christian rhetoric. plantinga’s proper function story works the same way. there exists a truth you can’t fully specify, belief tends to converge to it under the right conditions and those conditions just happen to be the right social and epistemic environment. the only difference here is that god has been swapped out for “consistency” and church has been swapped out for books and institutions
[31/12/25, 12:09:41] Haziq KXHL: @⁨~Ada Ge⁩ hol' up ada, just one more point and im outta here LOL
[31/12/25, 12:10:16] Haziq KXHL: well actually make it like 3 😅
[31/12/25, 12:11:18] Haziq KXHL: your three conditions translated:

impartiality requires disposable resources
moral clarity improves with leisure
joe’s material constraints explain why he doesn’t see what you see

you and joe are equal on care unequal on access to truth. elite epistemic asymmetry.
“joe public is irrational” rewritten more politely.

you say “i don’t think that’s true” but a lot seems to rest on what you think and don’t think given you’re making normative claims about how the world should be run and your people are actively trying to make it that way. books aren’t telescopes. history is full of highly literate highly reflective elites who converged very confidently on atrocities
[31/12/25, 12:12:05] Haziq KXHL: once axioms are gone “serve the most underserved” just means serve your taste
i’d rather you admit joe is collateral damage under a formal system
taste with authority is worse
[31/12/25, 12:13:39] Haziq KXHL: you renounce axioms then quietly inherit other people’s without owning any of them?
“implicit citation graph” is a way of saying the commitments matter but can’t be examined yet
in other words: give me the authority now, i’ll justify it later (maybe 😬)
[31/12/25, 12:14:42] Haziq KXHL: we’ve had appeal to authority
then appeal to empathy
then appeal to uncertainty
then appeal to “most effective altruists aren’t like that”

now we’ve landed on appeal to math i’ll do later

i think we’ve completed the tour. im done here (for now). adios ✌️
[31/12/25, 12:15:11] ~ Ada Ge: oughhh
can we move to substack?
im gonna use the appeal to "im just puppy" now
[31/12/25, 12:18:07] Haziq KXHL: lol nah substack is for people with something to preach
i’ve got nothing to sell
i’m meursault remember?
this is just entertainment for the kxhl audience
[31/12/25, 12:18:39] Haziq KXHL: i’m not trying to be right in public
i’m just being annoying in private
[31/12/25, 12:19:36] ~ Ada Ge: sigh,, haha
[31/12/25, 12:22:19] Haziq KXHL: btw guys feel free to chime in
are people following or is this just two people shadowboxing for kxhl lore 😭🤣
[31/12/25, 12:25:11] ~ Ada Ge: https://brettongoods.substack.com/p/gambling-on-development-review i like this review
[31/12/25, 12:27:00] Yi Hein: Omg I’ve met him in Singapore during his hack session a few years back
[31/12/25, 12:27:14] ~ Ada Ge: omg! he's so cool
[31/12/25, 12:36:26] Haziq KXHL: this is a nice explanation of how elites gamble on development
it’s not an answer to who authorised the casino

and your answer still seems to be that no one needs to because the public is too stupid and you’re smart enough to bypass the democratic process

so what exactly makes you so smart?
you’ve copped out of math
you’ve copped out of axioms
you’ve copped out of formalisation
[31/12/25, 12:38:19] Haziq KXHL: also don’t give me gambling bait knowing full well i come from a long line of trash-talking street poker players
i *_will_* turn that into a bit ☠️
[31/12/25, 12:48:52] Haziq KXHL: but you’re pivoting to a different question. this doesn’t justify your ea position whatsoever.

elite-bargain theory quietly assumes growth leads to broad welfare. that assumption is exactly what the last decade of inequality economics has been trying to formalise and test. thomas piketty’s entire corpus is basically a sustained attack on it.

what we find instead is that growth leads to capital concentration unless actively countered. growth doesn’t trickle down, it trickles up. without progressive taxation and redistributive policy, growth produces a net positive flux from the working and middle class to the elite.
[31/12/25, 12:51:41] ~ Ada Ge: id like to make it clear im not gonna say more on the chat
[31/12/25, 12:54:50] Haziq KXHL: valid
in that case i’m starting a weekly KXHL series where i take the most steelman Effective Altruism argument / formal system / whatever and put it under a public guillotine
consider it my new year resolution
[31/12/25, 12:57:41] ~ manav: I think the reason why you’re able to take EA to the cleaners in this way is because there is such a legibility asymmetry. Isolated demands of rigour from EA folk while being “Mersault who cares about wealth inequality”. Ada could avoid being rinsed if she j said “I’m Mersault who cares about shrimp” but by putting forward a basis for her decision making she’s opened herself up to critique. Why don’t you do the same?
[31/12/25, 12:59:17] ~ manav: Like I’m not an EA fan myself but I’m less enthusiastic to do what you’re doing because I know that articulating credible alternatives is hard
[31/12/25, 13:07:42] ~ manav: Also I think it’s pretty bad faith to ask EAs to find ways to justify the actions of deranged elites who are also EAs unless their worldviews specifically demand them to defend those elites. Average EA I know is a vegan quant who donates 60k a year to malaria vaccines and vitamin A drops to kids in sub Saharan Africa do they don’t go blind. Like all worldviews this is one that produces good and also has extreme runoff which is damaging. You’re a socialist but nobody is critiquing you by referencing Pol Pot or Stalin because good faith people respect individual agency
[31/12/25, 13:18:19] ~ manav: Sorry to keep coming back to this but like for real what proportion of EAs do you think support the current technocratic capture of US institutions? idt I’ve ever seen a more intense strawman of a group of relatively benign people
[31/12/25, 13:34:59] Haziq KXHL: the bad faith isn’t implicit, it’s declared. this mersault doesn’t actually care about wealth inequality or shrimp or anything for that matter. that’s kind of the point.

the asymmetry exists because one side is asking for institutional power. if ada just said “i care about shrimp, full stop” there’s no asymmetry anymore. once it’s a basic commitment, it stops being something you can preach as a rational moral stance or use to justify running institutions a certain way or romanticise people who are willing to override democracy because they think they’ve seen the truth.

she opened herself up to critique the moment she tried to give it a rational foundation. once you ask for the levers, you owe people axioms. if you don’t want to do that, don’t ask for the levers.
[31/12/25, 13:35:36] Haziq KXHL: i’m a nihilist remember? articulating credible alternatives is your problem, not mine
[31/12/25, 13:37:14] Haziq KXHL: the point isn’t that the dystopia is imminent or that most EAs are bad people. it’s to show where the normie shrimp-loving very sincere EA is willing to go once tradeoffs get hard. and we’ve already seen that willingness to bypass democracy come out pretty clearly
[31/12/25, 13:53:05] ~ manav: Is Ada (or any given non-super elite EA) asking for institutional power? Or does she just adhere to a framework for moral decision making? I genuinely don’t know but it seems like a hugely loaded assumption
[31/12/25, 13:55:28] ~ manav: Where are they “willing to go” exactly? Haven’t seen anything nefarious in this chat at least
[31/12/25, 14:03:05] ~ manav: Just so I understand exactly what your point is - are you implying that to put forward a systematic moral framework in any capacity is to seek institutional capture or subjugate the actions of other people?
[31/12/25, 14:03:43] ~ manav: Or that disagreeing with vernacular moral norms automatically implies that you want to restrict the agency of normal non-EA people?
[31/12/25, 14:05:11] ~ manav: I actually quite like vernacular morality that builds up from family to community to country to world. But even I can see that this is an absolutely insane thing to claim and grill people on
[31/12/25, 14:26:07] Haziq KXHL: no. that’s not the claim.

having a moral framework is fine. disagreeing with vernacular norms is fine. none of that implies wanting to restrict anyone’s agency.

the problem starts when a moral framework is treated as something people should accept regardless of consent. subjective stances should add up to consensus and be enacted through democracy, not smuggled in as objective truth that institutions are meant to follow.

once you move from “this is how i choose to act” to “this is how the world should be run” you’re no longer just doing morality. you’re making a power claim. and that’s what i’m pushing back on.
[31/12/25, 14:27:02] Haziq KXHL: no totally, just a private moral framework
that’s why it needs evangelising, fellowships, reading lists, career advice, donor networks and a mailing list
purely personal belief, like jehovah’s witnesses but with spreadsheets
[31/12/25, 14:29:25] Haziq KXHL: no one here is twirling a moustache. that’s exactly the problem. you’ve built a moral language where well-meaning people feel comfortable sidelining consent, refusing to own the basis for its judgments and still acting like nothing nefarious happened. that’s where it’s willing to go.
[31/12/25, 14:39:18] ~ Euan Ong: (drive by, random thoughts)

as an ea-ish, perhaps annoyingly ecumenical, person (for which both sides will probably hate me), here’s how i think about the world

let’s suppose that our intuition / our conscience is some noisy function of a moral ground truth. one could say that the job of moral systems is to fit models to this noisy function.

in this world, EA (or really “a particular flavour of utilitarian ethics”) is one such model of how to do good.

and models are great! building a model of your conscience gives you something you can study and optimise. and these sort of models can be very useful when working out how to optimise one particular part of your “moral function” within specific boundaries. (e.g. “there’s a part of me that cares about reducing global suffering writ large, and is willing to assign £X and Y hours of thinking to it. what do i do”).

but all models are broken, and I’d be wary of blindly extrapolating such a model to all parts of one’s life (or worse, forcing a model upon everyone).

when extrapolating out of the training distribution, whether one model is better than another is entirely a function of your priors — unless you have a strong prior internally that this should be the case, there’s no reason why your linear model _should_ be the best fit out of distribution. (indeed, we find very few things to be linear _indefinitely_.)

and above all I think it’s a mistake to confuse the map for the territory and to treat your model as axiomatic or ground truth reality (“if your intuition differs from your model, your intuition is by default wrong”). 

yes, our intuition is indeed often noisy / biased and deserves introspection. but i want the default action upon noticing the map not matching the territory to be _i notice i’m confused; let me think about what i actually care about_, rather than _my intuition is by default wrong_.
[31/12/25, 14:41:22] Haziq KXHL: _squinting past the chatgpt_ 👀
[31/12/25, 14:41:27] ~ Euan Ong: (more broadly: it’s very hard to come up with one simple function that fits the whole distribution. i feel comfortable with “moral ensembling” / having different functions that fit different parts of the distribution. yes, this bit seems sensible and linear and I’ll model it with a linear function. but that bit is weird and doesn’t look linear. maybe it’s noise and should be linear. or maybe it’s actually a cusp and I should treat it as such. maybe I should just use an SVM instead)

and here svm => virtue ethics but that’s a whole other conversation ‎<This message was edited>
[31/12/25, 14:42:01] ~ Euan Ong: ~oh dear. i did write this myself. maybe my writing style is devolving~
[31/12/25, 14:43:07] Haziq KXHL: lol just kidding, gptzero approved ✅
[31/12/25, 14:59:13] Haziq KXHL: okkk once again... since y’all are intent on speaking in tongues... lemme break it down for the broader audience
1. you assume *moral realism* . basically one true set of rights and wrongs folks...
2. our intuitions are treated as noisy measurements of that truth
3. moral frameworks are then “models” fit to your vibes
4. models are useful. no argument there.
5. extrapolation is risky. overfitting out-of-distribution etc.
6. at this point model choice becomes “a matter of priors” i.e. hierarchical bayes has entered the room to intimidate you
7. finally don’t always trust the model over intuition
[31/12/25, 15:01:47] Haziq KXHL: step 1 is doing all the work. “there exists one true moral order.”
congrats youve reinvented the church 👍
swapped god for loss function, bible for a spreadsheet, and priest for guy named Will with substack account
[31/12/25, 15:05:04] Haziq KXHL: step 6 is the escape hatch. they say “it’s prior-driven” and the conversation is supposed to stop.
same as when you hit the ugly bits of the bible (racism, misogyny etc) and suddenly it’s “context” and “interpretation”
[31/12/25, 15:12:41] Haziq KXHL: btw don’t come at me with “oh so you hate moral realism / oh so you hate the church”
i don’t care
i’m just translating what’s being said
[31/12/25, 15:14:51] ~ Euan Ong: yes, i don’t dispute this — this is the internal framework i choose to use
[31/12/25, 15:15:00] ~ Euan Ong: to be clear, I’m not advocating that other ppl hold it
[31/12/25, 15:15:22] ~ Euan Ong: I’m just illustrating how i think about / use EAish models within my life
[31/12/25, 15:15:40] ~ Euan Ong: / one possible way to find utilitarian ethics useful without it becoming all consuming
[31/12/25, 15:20:29] Haziq KXHL: small psa for anyone about to jump in

big well-funded movement with real lobbying power ends up with moral views wildly out of sync with the public, decides the public is too dumb to decide and concludes it’s ethical to bypass democracy.
[31/12/25, 15:24:15] ~ manav: > nihilist
> “should”

But even putting that aside this stinks of reddit-era antireligion arguments. “All Christians are tout court homophobic bigots because the Bible contains homophobic passages” and stuff like that. This sort of thing just totally obliterates the variety of shades of human experience, how people relate to institutions on an individual level and construct sui generis personal frameworks with varying degrees of adherence
[31/12/25, 15:27:00] ~ manav: Criticise the institutions (in this case large well funded EA pressure groups or whatever) all you like, that’s totally valid
[31/12/25, 15:27:59] ~ manav: Can you see how you’re collapsing a whole range of people into the actions of the most intense acolytes lol
[31/12/25, 15:28:08] ~ Ada Ge: i don't think that's constructive because some parts are misleading and other parts are just not true
[31/12/25, 15:28:53] ~ manav: I want you to articulate exactly how “sidelining consent” or undermining democracy falls out of what’s been presented on here
[31/12/25, 15:28:59] ~ manav: I think you’re tilting at windmills
[31/12/25, 15:30:06] ~ Ada Ge: i think you can tell if you took yourself and your time and the rest of our time a bit more seriously
[31/12/25, 15:30:30] ~ Ada Ge: like not 100% more but like 10% more
[31/12/25, 15:34:29] ~ manav: Reasonable question to ask: as someone who nominally identifies with the EA movement do you support the actions of x group who has done n bad things

Baseless and unreasonable: as a member of a different moral football team you are personally accountable for the institutional failures of people you don’t know, have never met, and quite possibly disagree with
[31/12/25, 15:44:08] ~ manav: If anyone is wondering why I’m gunning for EA so hard, it’s because (a) sneer club histrionics are uniquely irritating to me, and (b) most of the EAs I know personally do huge amounts of good both locally and globally by criteria I’d say are almost universally shared and I don’t feel a need to shit on them because I disagree with their moral primitives
[31/12/25, 16:53:33] Haziq KXHL: okkk ouch point taken. i’ll drop the hyperbole about an imminent EA shrimp world order or 99% of EAs trying to overthrow democracy.

to instead focus on moral primitives and the conclusions they lead to so it’s easier for the avg person to see whether EA actually matches their worldview. basically replacing phone insurance sales with gocompare.

so far we’ve already got a shrimp threshold where a human life becomes expendable. that’s just arithmetic. let’s see what else drops out.
[31/12/25, 16:56:17] ~ manav: I think this is totally fair. “These conclusions are the limit case of this worldview” is certainly a very good reductio against holding a worldview to its limit case :)
[31/12/25, 16:57:00] Haziq KXHL: this isn’t about how individual christians relate to scripture or whether they squint at certain passages or stick pride flags on them. i don’t care.

i’m concerned with separation of church and state. what institutions are allowed to enforce, justify or bypass consent using contested moral frameworks.

kinda besides the point i guess since EA isn’t literally trying to overthrow democracy. supposedly. at least not yet.
[31/12/25, 16:57:57] ~ manav: Where we can find common ground is just like any worldview, there are some EAs who seem to truly believe that they can take their worldview to the limit case and some of these people are very close to power and we need to be wary of those specific individuals
[31/12/25, 16:58:37] ~ manav: But generalising that characteristic to the entire population of people who associate with said worldview is literally the underlying logic of every kind of discrimination
[31/12/25, 16:59:07] ~ manav: What I instead advocate is that we should all try to hold our beliefs more lightly
[31/12/25, 16:59:39] Haziq KXHL: possible. i do remember being warned about false dichotomies by… someone 👀
[31/12/25, 18:20:50] Haziq KXHL: wait hold on doc serious q… dsm-5 doesn’t distinguish between wild-type and club histrionics. are you saying i’m a rare variant??
[31/12/25, 18:21:06] Haziq KXHL: so like… is club histrionic worse than regular histrionic or is it just more social??
[31/12/25, 19:06:55] ~ manav: I meant it in the non-pathological casual sense
[31/12/25, 22:05:39] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: https://www.instagram.com/reel/DS5Aq6NDIIS omg this came up in my feed you guys are gonna love this 😂😂

[31/12/25, 22:51:56] Haziq KXHL: i acc thought u meant monetizing my looks and persona as shareholder value. that i can do. lmk where i sign the fashion contract

[31/12/25, 23:00:25] Haziq KXHL: gq or calvin klein preferably but i’m open to competitive offers
[31/12/25, 23:01:49] Haziq KXHL: worst case i pivot to growth: hinge downloads up immediately, capitalism wins

[1/1/26, 08:28:56] Haziq KXHL: if ur 12.00 impulse was “let’s go wish these hack club jerks happy new year” i regret to inform u that ur not taking new year very seriously… reverse anthropic principle
[1/1/26, 08:29:17] Haziq KXHL: sorry guys new year new me was supposed to be less bits
[1/1/26, 10:41:40] Haziq KXHL: @⁨~manav⁩ bro idk if new year is even the right time to bring this up but i’ve been wondering if your skepticism toward the primitives of computational neuro comes from foundationlist commitments... isnt that kind of similar to soviet era dialectics driven research? like structuring scientific inquiry around prior metaphysical commitments 🤔
[1/1/26, 10:44:22] Haziq KXHL: cos im personally very much a follow-the-model-that-makes-good-predictions-ist and i prefer not to dwell on the primitives of any theory. just care about what pops out
[1/1/26, 10:46:46] Haziq KXHL: *except if the model in question’s name starts with an E and ends with an A. in that case i acc care a lot about primitives 😮‍💨

[1/1/26, 13:36:50] ~ manav: I think this is totally fine and agree that prior metaphysical commitments that intrude onto the empirical field are bad metaphysics
[1/1/26, 13:44:22] ~ manav: My issue w “comp neuro primitives” are nothing to do with comp neuro itself as an effective way of modelling neural circuits (I would consider myself a computational neuroscientist and am optimistic about the paradigm). More that the majority of ppl I’ve met who do comp neuro bring along some additional metaphysical baggage that I think makes it difficult to scope the model well (eliminative materialism, deflationary theories of consciousness)
[1/1/26, 13:47:21] ~ manav: To be specific I know a lot of people in this field who are tacitly or explicitly Dennett-pilled and believe that the neuroscientific project is “Quining consciousness” like it’s a vernacular placeholder in the same manner as elan vital or phlogiston
[1/1/26, 14:00:45] ~ Euan Ong: where is it?

[1/1/26, 20:28:11] Haziq KXHL: every week like clockwork but the clock is broken
[1/1/26, 20:33:05] Haziq KXHL: oh woww totally with you on this. yeah no its acc them who are doing dialectics here
quining qualia was initially appealing to me cos it felt like it just followed from reductionism and materialism which are kind of the basic building blocks of science
but the more i think about it the more it feels like a cop out like instead of trying to reduce qualia and find their material basis, youre just declaring the target confused and moving on
real reductionism should explain subjective experience... baking in deflationary views of consciousness as a starting assumption does seem like a unjustified metaphysical constraint

[1/1/26, 22:03:02] ~ manav: Any theory that tries to deflate consciousness on the basis of empirical findings undermines the very faculty that gives validity to the empirical findings. What I mean by that is that evidence is always experienced
[1/1/26, 22:05:04] ~ manav: So if I’m like ‘actually consciousness is a composite of various neural processes with the illusion of coherence’ on the basis of seeing reliable NCCs I’ve now destabilised the medium through which empirical evidence (witnessing the NCCs, cognising their implications) arrives to me. It’s all sense data eventually, how can I trust that _it_ isn’t nonsense with the illusion of coherence ‎<This message was edited>
[1/1/26, 22:05:32] ~ manav: I view this as an incompleteness problem. The system (conscious experience) cannot ground its own axioms

[2/1/26, 13:11:12] ~ Vishnu Raj: Hi everyone 👋 I joined yesterday!
I’ve built a product that already has 500+ users, but I still have 0 paid users.
I’m not great at the final execution part like pricing, launch, and sales. If anyone has suggestions or can point me to a good playbook/framework to convert free users to paid, I’d really appreciate it 🙏
[2/1/26, 13:13:14] ~ manav: I think coherent optimism is still possible but it requires carefully disentangling things. The only thing that needs to be treated as functionally transcendental is the quality of being a subject, i.e. a bare being-awareness to which objects appear. Anything that is an object is in principle empiricism-apt. All forms of mentation including self-awareness exist as objects in relation to the transcendental subject (you can observe your thoughts lol) so we can probably derive neural bases for these things and even speculate about non-biological substrates for mental activity. This way, by disambiguating the mind from awareness, we can 95% have our cake and eat it too, but the 5% is very important. What you cannot do is beg the question wrt self-referentiality à la Hofstadter’s strange loop, or think that you can empirically ground the very fact of experience itself. All of this seems pretty palatable until you realise that it demands you to take a promethean plunge away from materialism in a very non-intuitive way, e.g. instead of thinking about deep sleep as an absence of experience I now have to think about it as the experience of absence
[2/1/26, 14:44:00] Yi Hein: welcome!
[2/1/26, 14:44:26] Yi Hein: @⁨~David L⁩ any tips?
[2/1/26, 14:57:01] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Figure out the pricing model (freemium, premium only, trial, etc) - you can build your intuition around this looking at what others do + A/B testing. It helps a lot if you know what’s the core feature they like that they’d pay a premium for. 
Then decide the price - similar process to above.
[2/1/26, 15:24:07] ~ Vishnu Raj: Totally agree. I think I have been treating everything as free value without a clear premium hook.
What’s your go-to way to decide what becomes paid gate features, usage limits, or outcomes?
[2/1/26, 15:36:01] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Really depends on the app but I love usage limits - you can show app’s full value then
[2/1/26, 15:43:29] ~ Vishnu Raj: Great. One more question if you don’t mind: for organic growth, what would you prioritize first SEO content, community posts (Reddit/Facebook groups), or partnerships/affiliates? I’m trying to pick 1–2 channels and go deep.

[2/1/26, 17:44:37] Hera KXHL: i’m recovering from a stomach bug but i’ll say what i’m working on
[2/1/26, 17:51:38] ~ Anna Magpie: ‎~ Anna Magpie joined using a group link.
[2/1/26, 17:48:24] Hera KXHL: i’m building a tool that ports an audio file straight into my template in my digital audio workstation, so when i download something into a set folder, it automatically creates a project file and i can start to work on it straight away. this is convenient for me when i’m recording with a backing track, saves clicking around
[2/1/26, 17:49:11] ~ Alex Pylypenko: i love the sound of this!
[2/1/26, 17:49:57] Hera KXHL: LOL thank you
[2/1/26, 17:50:44] Hera KXHL: no way is this alex who made BIO helper
[2/1/26, 17:50:58] ~ Alex Pylypenko: yes, that's me 😭

[2/1/26, 19:15:53] Haziq KXHL: Ok so where is everyone?
[2/1/26, 19:35:41] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: I’m still away chilling across England haha
[2/1/26, 19:37:10] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Again, depends but my intuition: if you genuinely know someone who has your target customers, partnerships > posts that answer as a solution to what it solves (don’t spam, lol!) > SEO unless it’s very specific problem.

[2/1/26, 20:49:46] Haziq KXHL: @⁨Yi Hein⁩ we now officially have two biologists in KXHL. this is no longer a hack club, it is a wet lab. please respect our authority.
[2/1/26, 20:51:22] Yi Hein: Omg yeah when the session first started I was like you should def talk to Haziq
[2/1/26, 20:51:55] Haziq KXHL: But establishment STILL won’t recognize our demographic 😔
I fear it’s time… we must establish a democratic socialist government for KXHL 🗳️✊
[2/1/26, 20:52:42] Yi Hein: fine fine, I’ll redeploy the website HAHAHA to include scientists
[2/1/26, 20:52:55] Yi Hein: Also gonna revamp the copy
[2/1/26, 21:04:31] Haziq KXHL: Hi hello yes lemme take over from my junior associate @⁨~Tuhan Sapumanage⁩ , head of growth for KXHL here 🧑‍💼
everyone joined purely because of my magnetic personality 

Playbook: IKEA furniture manual
Framework: “If it works it works”

Our core monetization strategies include (but are not limited to):
• pyramid schemes 
• pretend the free tier is actually the trial
• gaslight users into thinking they already paid
[2/1/26, 21:07:01] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: You’re a walking compliance risk man 😂😂😂
[4/1/26, 21:39:40] Haziq KXHL: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/14-73-the-challenge-of-world-poverty-spring-2011/

sharing these lectures that i really like

taught at mit in 2011 by Esther Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee
this was pre-nobel, back when they were just… teaching
(yes they’re married and yes they both won the econ nobel. curies of econ)

at the time it was basically just them walking undergrads through experiments data and uncomfortable results about poverty

in hindsight it’s acc two future nobel laureates building the intellectual scaffolding for how poverty is studied and addressed today. piece by piece, in public. just wow

irrespective of what framework you think is best for dealing with poverty
it’s useful to be aware of the basic facts of life
[4/1/26, 22:03:08] ~ Ada Ge: oh I really like these two
[4/1/26, 22:04:25] ~ Ada Ge: i also like sen and nussbaum's capabilities approach

[7/1/26, 23:25:43] Haziq KXHL: 👆The paper in question
[7/1/26, 23:28:43] Haziq KXHL: tl;dr hey moral realists, singer just weaponised your axioms to make indifference prosecutable. how does the defendant wish to proceed?
[7/1/26, 23:33:20] Haziq KXHL: but also singer is genuinely scary because the more clever you try to be poking holes, the more stupid he makes you look.  and then the final blow is that he actually lives according to his claims. austere lifestyle, wealth redirected to relief efforts
[7/1/26, 23:38:15] Haziq KXHL: final thought… this is also historically important because this is basically the birth of Effective Altruism. look how spectacular it was back then. moral urgency, personal cost, no safety rails. then silicon valley “optimised” it and suddenly everyone had a framework to avoid doing the thing ‎<This message was edited>
[8/1/26, 00:01:31] Haziq KXHL: @⁨~Alex Pylypenko⁩ dragging emotivism out of nowhere 💀 but genuinely if moral attitudes are just evolutionary + cultural behavioral biases (both of which are… extremely sus: evolution optimises for survival not truth and culture is inherited trash) then why wouldn’t indifference be the default?

Like as a thinking rational person I can recognise those biases and resist them which lands me at indifference. What exactly is wrong with that position according to you?
[8/1/26, 00:43:28] Yi Hein: I’ll let the EA people answer this, I’m lacking way too much context
[8/1/26, 00:44:11] Yi Hein: Also news flash: @⁨~manav⁩ @⁨~Laith⁩ is it time for us to pack our bags? https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-health/

[8/1/26, 00:48:26] ~ samia 💗🌸: The Facebook “health” echo chambers may get worse
[8/1/26, 00:50:29] ~ samia 💗🌸: The wellness part of “health and wellness” could just be people trauma dumping about their boss or relationship so I’d take that with a pinch of salt. But it will be slightly worrying to watch this play out imo depending on how well it’s regulated
[8/1/26, 01:05:43] ~ manav: I believe the technical term for this situation is “it’s joever”
[8/1/26, 01:08:51] ~ manav: But to be serious I think illness is incredibly high-dimensional. Almost everything we think of as healthcare today is automatable to some degree but (and maybe this is stupidly optimistic) my conclusion from this is that we are doing healthcare in a state of pure triage
[8/1/26, 01:09:31] ~ manav: We have not even begun to explore what healthcare could look like when the basement of maslow’s hierarchy is met universally
[8/1/26, 01:12:00] ~ manav: Prior/present forms that I think are directionally accurate for where we are heading if we get an AI good ending: concierge care in post-scarcity pockets if the world, 19th century visiting physicians
[8/1/26, 01:17:07] Yi Hein: once the models are good enough, you can overcome the robotics challenge by having para-professionals using AI to “vibe diagnose” - at the point when diagnostic accuracy has been proven to be better than human doctors
[8/1/26, 13:20:20] Yi Hein: @⁨Haziq KXHL⁩ sorry I buried ur message, bumping this for visibility
[8/1/26, 15:22:48] Haziq KXHL: hmm random thought but I heard someone in this GC started their CS undergrad at 13 and then went on to do some pretty cool stuff… not sure who that could be though. would love to hear more. but perhaps @⁨~Tuhan Sapumanage⁩ knows who I mean?
[8/1/26, 15:24:47] Haziq KXHL: no worries, looks like no one wants to be Singer-trapped today 😭
[8/1/26, 16:08:56] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Hahaha thanks for the shoutout man. Well, yes - did my first bachelors in CompSci at 13. It was mostly for intellectual curiosity (did my first website at 11 :)). Focusing on data science, AI/ML these days. Google me up and always happy to connect and collab haha! Cheers!!!
[8/1/26, 16:11:54] Haziq KXHL: 🔥🔥
“google me” is such an insane flex 😭
[8/1/26, 16:12:51] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Thanks for hyping me up - just happy coincidences of doing the right things haha 😂❤️

[8/1/26, 19:18:22] Haziq KXHL: evolutionary theorist rates this LLM slop highly 👍
[8/1/26, 19:24:52] Haziq KXHL: i love this aesthetically

but fr this stuff is also kinda irritating
when you squint it’s mostly branding
alphazero already did self play so idk why calling it red queen is meant to earn brownie points

there’s no new application of evo theory to actually improve deep learning
and on the flip side this simulation doesn’t tell us anything new about adaptive systems either

if you fix the constraints there will always be some optimal way to win within those constraints
so convergent behaviour is like yeah ok obviously

cool demo of arms races
not a conceptual advance
[8/1/26, 19:35:09] Haziq KXHL: https://www.evolutionaryscale.ai/
i love this although i die a little everytime i visit their website
[8/1/26, 19:36:00] Yi Hein: what’s wrong with their website though
[8/1/26, 19:36:13] ~ Alex Pylypenko: AI-powered design
[8/1/26, 19:36:15] ~ Alex Pylypenko: i think
[8/1/26, 19:37:35] Yi Hein: doesn’t really feel like it though, vibe coded sites has purple everywhere with extensive use of emojis
[8/1/26, 19:37:54] ~ Alex Pylypenko: that's iff you use the openai models
[8/1/26, 19:39:16] Yi Hein: perhaps the different part here is that each agent codes and executes commands in a computer? which is a much larger action space than chess
‎[8/1/26, 19:42:02] Yi Hein: They also seems to be focused on the practical applications of this rather than generating novel conceptual breakthroughs ‎image omitted
[8/1/26, 19:43:31] Haziq KXHL: they offhandedly mention a simulation result that’s probably correct
like i don’t dispute the result at all, there's been other work on this
but if you take it seriously it kind of breaks the timeline
[8/1/26, 19:43:44] Haziq KXHL: which is why i die a little every time i see it dropped so casually 😭
[8/1/26, 19:44:25] Haziq KXHL: lemme explain properly in a couple of minutes
[8/1/26, 19:48:44] Haziq KXHL: yeah valid
but calling it red queen feels like begging for theory clout

empirical self-play result in a bigger action space
so fair engineering demo
[8/1/26, 20:13:41] Yi Hein: https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec

just discovered this: parallel english version of your codebase, as you grow in complexity the spec updates alongside

imagining at some point companies start selling specs, and companies that buy them can build an entire SaaS with AI
[8/1/26, 20:14:40] Yi Hein: specs take a long time to develop because you need to encounter real world problems with real users ‎<This message was edited>
[8/1/26, 20:14:48] Yi Hein: but software is getting faster and cheaper to develop
[8/1/26, 20:20:51] Haziq KXHL: ok storytime, bring popcorn
‎[8/1/26, 20:21:06] Haziq KXHL: ‎image omitted
[8/1/26, 20:24:05] Haziq KXHL: marcel-paul schützenberger (absolute legend, medical doctor and professional counter unironically) did the maths on this decades ago. random mutation + selection is just a very inefficient way to search protein space. functional sequences are too sparse

so “would’ve taken nature 500m years” checks out

what’s weird is seeing it re-confirmed by modern simulations and then dropped as a throwaway line like cool demo btw, please ignore the part where you just speedran a foundational problem in evolutionary theory with zero regard for our feelings
[8/1/26, 20:26:32] Haziq KXHL: also if you’re thinking back to our fave book growing up, dawkins’ selfish gene, the monkey demo there is a total trompe-l’œil

it only works because he sneaks in an RL-style objective. the program is explicitly incentivised toward a target sequence

IRL there is no natural selection without already-functional proteins. one nucleotide change and the protein is cooked. cancer biology teaches you that much. this is not an incremental game

random mutations have basically zero de novo creative power. there’s no incentive to move toward structure. you create something fragile and break it the next moment because there is literally no selection pressure for most intermediates

500 million years for a puny fluorescent protein
humans have been around for like 6 million years
the number of new functionalities and proteins we have relative to prior species is massive

we genuinely do not currently have a theory that explains functional biological complexity
that’s our incompleteness problem
[8/1/26, 20:30:35] Haziq KXHL: and as if that weren’t bad enough... enter systems biology

now you don’t just have to explain individual proteins. you have to explain entire pathways made of zillions of intermediate proteins whose only job is to talk to each other

there is no selection for most of these intermediates on their own. a signaling protein that does nothing unless five other proteins already exist. has zero fitness advantage by itself

natural selection only “sees” function once the whole pathway is intact. but the pathway only works if all the pieces are already there. so selection cannot guide you toward it step by step

this is why evolutionary systems biology is genuinely cooked. the moment you zoom out from single genes to networks, the incremental story just collapses

if someone actually figures out how complex, coordinated biological pathways arise without sneaking in foresight or global objectives, give them the Nobel, the Turing, and the Fields. unironically
[8/1/26, 20:32:10] Yi Hein: why can’t intermediate functional states exist?
[8/1/26, 20:32:53] Yi Hein: you have 1 big protein that does the job (albeit poorly), then over time it breaks up into 5 smaller proteins each with specialised function
[8/1/26, 20:33:01] Yi Hein: (ie signalling pathway)
[8/1/26, 20:34:20] Yi Hein: you have RNA that is used for both information storage and translation. then you evolve to have DNA and RNA
[8/1/26, 20:36:11] Haziq KXHL: they do exist, in disney

in real biology protein folding is insanely finnicky. most single nucleotide variants already break function rather than gently degrade it. cancer biology is basically a graveyard of “small nucleotide change, catastrophic effect”

proteins are not lego bricks where you can split one big thing into five smaller things and keep partial functionality at each step. folding depends on very specific long-range interactions. once you change sequence length or context you usually lose structure entirely
[8/1/26, 20:37:00] Haziq KXHL: re the 1 big protein -> 5 specialised proteins idea. you’re assuming the big protein already does the full job and that the smaller ones can appear one by one while remaining useful

but in signalling pathways most intermediates are pure messengers. on their own they do nothing. no downstream partner means no function, so no selection pressure to preserve them
[8/1/26, 20:38:12] ~ Dylan: Obligatory https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1a5141e7ff8ce359a95de51b26c8cea4
[8/1/26, 20:39:49] Yi Hein: HAHAHA but there are learnt generalisations that don’t have to be specified
[8/1/26, 20:41:00] Haziq KXHL: the rna world thing is such a cliche at this point. that’s literally chapter 1 of every freshman bio textbook

that’s a biochemistry origin story, not the problem here

even if you grant RNA doing storage and catalysis, you’ve said nothing about how you scale to information-dense, tightly coordinated systems. that’s an information theory problem, not a “what molecule came first” question
[8/1/26, 20:42:00] Yi Hein: yeah but the cancer timescale is different right. also given how many pseudogenes we have, if can be possible that proteins are developed in the genetic stage, and until they become viable it then exerts it’s effects
[8/1/26, 20:42:21] Yi Hein: although i can’t answer what gives it the selection pressure without feedback
[8/1/26, 20:46:10] Yi Hein: my point is that you start with a simpler imperfect molecule that serves many functions, then you specialise
[8/1/26, 20:46:11] ~ Dylan: True true, although when people start talking about handling "real world problems and edge cases" with natural language specifications, I find it hard to imagine that the most efficient way to (reasonably accurately) represent that isn't with some form of code
[8/1/26, 20:46:26] Haziq KXHL: yeah that’s kind of the point

cancer evolves fast precisely because it’s almost entirely loss of function. you knock out brakes, negative regulators, checkpoints. no de novo creative power is needed

tumour evolution is great at breaking things, not at inventing new coherent machinery. that’s why you don’t see genuinely new proteins or pathways emerging, just rewiring and degradation
[8/1/26, 20:47:04] Haziq KXHL: and the timescale point actually cuts the other way. tumours go through absurd numbers of generations. if you do the back-of-the-envelope it’s basically time-dilated evolution comparable to or exceeding human evolutionary timescales

yet even there you don’t see new functional proteins popping up. mostly truncations, misfolds, copy number changes

so if even cancer, with huge population sizes and rapid selection, can’t invent new functional structure, that’s at least suggestive that random mutation is very bad at creation and very good at destruction
[8/1/26, 20:47:39] Yi Hein: also punctuated equilibrium/cambrian explosion shows occassional spikes in learning rate, so still possible even if it is not a gradual change
[8/1/26, 20:48:41] Haziq KXHL: you’re conflating two different things here. metabolic substrate and informational structure

a “simpler molecule that does many things poorly” works as a metabolism story. sure, chemistry can be sloppy and multifunctional

but information doesn’t work that way. you don’t get to gradually refine a vague blob of information into a precise, tightly coordinated system
[8/1/26, 20:48:49] Yi Hein: it doesn’t have to be accurate, it just have to solve the business problem. and there are probably 2000 solutions for the same problem. the AI just has to find one of them. the assumption (largely valid) is that describing the problem is much more concise than describing the solution
[8/1/26, 20:51:07] Haziq KXHL: that’s not an explanation, that’s a narrative patch

saying “punctuated equilibrium happened so learning rate spiked” is just assuming the thing you’re trying to explain. it’s basically surely it must have happened or else the story doesn’t work

there’s no mechanistic account of how the learning rate increases. no new search operator, no new source of coordination

the cambrian explosion is an empirical pattern, not a mechanism.

also stop anthropomorphising evolution. it’s not a learner, it doesn’t know when to speed up, it doesn’t get motivated.
[8/1/26, 20:56:34] Haziq KXHL: what really messed with me is seeing the same thing play out in non-biological systems

people at the Santa Fe Institute like Stephanie Forrest, tried using adaptive systems and genetic algorithms for stuff like automated bug fixing

they could never get de novo program generation to work. random search + selection just doesn’t invent new programs from scratch

but it works extremely well when like 99 percent of the program is already there. then evolution is great at nudging it, unearthing latent structure etc.

same pattern as biology. random mutation is good at tweaking & breaking. terrible at creating coherent structure from nothing

which is kind of the point. selection is a powerful filter as opposed to a creative engine
[8/1/26, 20:57:47] Yi Hein: so are you suggesting that there is another mechanism apart from the evolutionary theory we know today?
[8/1/26, 20:58:19] Haziq KXHL: istg if i didn’t already have biomedical research commitments this would be one hell of thing to spend a lifetime studying
the information problem has basically been sitting there unresolved since the 70s ‎<This message was edited>
[8/1/26, 21:01:43] Haziq KXHL: yeah basically yes, that’s what i mean by incompleteness
we know we are missing something, just not sure what
[8/1/26, 21:04:00] Haziq KXHL: alternatively, panspermia. someone tossed a 99 percent complete cell onto earth and said ok evolution, find the patch fixes

in that case i’m switching fields and we should all be at SETI
[8/1/26, 21:05:54] Yi Hein: also to counter the problem of protein instability, you modify your DNA to change how the same protein binds to DNA, for example how cortisol is able to have so many different functions in so many different parts of the body
[8/1/26, 21:07:37] Haziq KXHL: this is exactly the category error i’m pointing at

cortisol has many effects because there’s already a full receptor and regulatory architecture in place. those receptors are not a single nucleotide away from each other

changing binding context is just modulation within an existing scaffold. it doesn’t explain how new stable proteins or pathways get created in the first place
[8/1/26, 21:09:07] Haziq KXHL: this only counts as evidence for folding robustness if all those receptors were reachable by minor random mutations from each other, which they aren’t
[8/1/26, 21:14:11] Haziq KXHL: also keep in mind... most receptor families come from gene duplication + divergence

duplication gives you a free copy to mess with. it doesn’t explain where the first functional fold came from
[8/1/26, 21:16:14] Haziq KXHL: also cortisol isn’t even the spicy case. it’s highly conserved across species and had an enormous timescale to emerge

the real problem is the human-specific stuff that shows up over ~6 million years and sharply differentiates us from prior species. language, fine motor control, cortical reorg, developmental timing

that’s where the logic just says adios amigos
[8/1/26, 21:27:34] Yi Hein: someone tell uncle bob that you can develop an extremely complex system without clean code
[8/1/26, 21:29:00] Haziq KXHL: messy code scales only if there’s already a codebase. nobody bootstraps linux by randomly editing an empty directory
[8/1/26, 21:32:18] Haziq KXHL: to give a serious response:
developers always have a gradient of improvement. they know what better means even if the implementation is ugly
most biological intermediates have no gradient because they’re nonfunctional until a threshold is crossed
[8/1/26, 21:38:51] Haziq KXHL: i think the problem is that evolution gets taught like a living, intentional process

so people internalise “life finds a way” instead of treating it as a mathematical consequence of a very specific search process

once you anthropomorphise it, you start assuming creativity, direction, intent, problem-solving etc. that the mechanism itself doesn’t have
[8/1/26, 21:53:41] Haziq KXHL: also to give credit where it’s due + further reading, heres the intellectual lineage of these paradoxes:
* Murray Eden (MIT), at the 1966 wistar symposium he argued that random mutation + selection doesn’t obviously generate new biological information at the required rates. this is basically where the dna-as-information framing entered the debate
* Marcel-Paul Schützenberger, french medical doctor / mathematician at University of Paris. showed in 60s-70s that blind combinatorial search is wildly implausible for generating complex functional sequences.
* Manfred Eigen (1967 Nobel laureate Chemistry), he formalised the quasispecies model and the error threshold, which puts a hard information-theoretic limit on how much information you can stably maintain given mutation rates. this is where the “you can’t just accumulate unlimited information” result comes from
[8/1/26, 21:54:46] Haziq KXHL: so yeah when people say “life finds a way” they’re kinda skipping over 50 years of math that says "the way" is extremely constrained
[8/1/26, 21:56:13] Haziq KXHL: turns out if you don’t make people learn maths (looking at you classical biologists 😒), the theory slowly turns into a motivational quote
[8/1/26, 23:11:46] Haziq KXHL: ok just one more insane evo bio detail since i was yapping about Prum’s mate choice stuff some time ago

in most species mate choice is asymmetric. one side chooses, the other displays

in humans it’s bidirectional. both sides choose, both signal, both reject

absolutely unhinged species ngl

[9/1/26, 13:55:57] ~ Anna Magpie: ‎This message was deleted.
[9/1/26, 13:59:21] ~ Anna Magpie: So one of the questions I was interested in for a bit, then gave up on because almost no one is studying this
[9/1/26, 13:59:34] ~ Anna Magpie: Is evolution of evolvability
[9/1/26, 14:02:50] ~ Anna Magpie: You might expect there to be evolutionary pressure, in sufficiently quickly changing environments, towards "smoothing out the gradient", in variants on genes which are close together could benefit from improving the ability of the other gene to mutate in beneficial ways
[9/1/26, 14:05:59] ~ Anna Magpie: And also in general one of the things I think you should strongly expect is strong degrees of regulatory modularity, so things can be easily repurposed. We see this in evo devo! Sets of genes which interact in ways that can be easily utilized for other purposes will be more successful than ones that can't be
[9/1/26, 14:08:09] ~ Anna Magpie: Ooh @⁨Haziq KXHL⁩ i have a journal club idea for the next time I'm in town, have you read this paper: 
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.02.498577v1.full.pdf

Tbh I'm lacking the maths background to wholly make sense of it but that's something I'm fixing and also last time I wasn't using ChatGPT to explain it to me
[9/1/26, 14:12:24] ~ manav: Lowkey affirming the consequent here
[9/1/26, 14:12:38] ~ manav: My bad as you were guys
[9/1/26, 14:21:47] ~ manav: @⁨Haziq KXHL⁩ do you think this search space constraint applies to simple replicators too?
[9/1/26, 14:24:40] ~ Anna Magpie: You didn't ask but it depends on how simple?
[9/1/26, 14:33:05] ~ manav: I guess what I mean to ask is the (very naive) understanding I had before reading through this conversation was basically that the combinatoric space of the primeval soup in terms of time, energy, and simple chemicals was large enough to necessitate replicators at some point and then just stochastic gradient ascent up a stability landscape. But now not so sure
[9/1/26, 14:33:38] ~ manav: Also it feels like the whole tpot-adjacent simcluster has colonised this gc LMAO
[9/1/26, 14:34:34] ~ Anna Magpie: Replication _itself_ is quite a basic process, this is why the RNA world theory is so standard
[9/1/26, 14:35:05] ~ manav: So does the search space only expand dramatically when we have to account for stable interactions?
[9/1/26, 14:36:02] ~ Anna Magpie: The search space gets really expansive when you have to generate new properties that aren't intrinsic to the molecule
[9/1/26, 14:36:34] ~ Anna Magpie: *intrinsic to the basic chemistry of the molecule
[9/1/26, 14:37:15] ~ manav: Struggling to scope the implications of this idea. What about endosymbiosis? Surely “happy accident” is underdetermined in a similar way
[9/1/26, 14:38:30] ~ Anna Magpie: I don't really know about this, seems likely that it would be, that's why many abiogenesis people say that complex eukaryotic life is the "1 in a billion" part
[9/1/26, 14:39:49] ~ Anna Magpie: (but whether it's under or overdetermined is super contingent on early earth ecology)
[9/1/26, 14:43:06] ~ manav: Hmmm but surely something like endosymbiosis is just a higher abstraction of the same contingent processes that we are saying can’t be accounted for in the “life finds a way” model? Just the right mutation to inactivate lysozome(-precursors/equivalents), stable inactivating mutations on the phagcytosed bacterium’s end, etc
[9/1/26, 14:43:31] Haziq KXHL: ahh @⁨~Anna Magpie⁩ my fellow biologist has entered the chat 🤝
there’s been a lot of interesting comments and a lot to say so lemme go through this one by one slowly while i’m in the middle of like 10 other things lol 😭
[9/1/26, 14:44:20] ~ manav: Like as Haziq said earlier, neither unicellular organism “wants” symbiosis or anything. Any explanation has to be totally stochastic right ‎<This message was edited>
[9/1/26, 14:45:19] ~ Anna Magpie: This is true, but specifics matter
[9/1/26, 14:45:41] ~ Anna Magpie: I.e lof mutations constitute a much broader portion of the space than gof
[9/1/26, 14:45:52] Haziq KXHL: yeah that’s kind of the annoying thing about evolution as a field
most of the work is happening at the phenotypic or developmental level like bird beaks and evo devo

that work is useful but it conditions on the genetic architecture already being there
it explains how you tune or rearrange a system, not how you get a system that is even tunable in the first place

very little of the literature seriously asks what kind of genetic and informational architecture is needed for random mutation and local selection to navigate the space at all

this is basically what Schützenberger was getting at when he said neo darwinism works well once things are already in place but struggles to explain how that structure arises in the first place
[9/1/26, 14:48:17] ~ Anna Magpie: You're familiar with Stuart Russell, specifically *Origins of Order*?
[9/1/26, 14:49:02] Haziq KXHL: i’m still unsure it actually closes the informational gap rather than redescribing it in dynamical terms
[9/1/26, 14:50:27] ~ Anna Magpie: Fair
[9/1/26, 14:55:19] ~ manav: I think Yi Hein might have alr brought this up but wdyt of neofunctionalisation
[9/1/26, 14:56:23] ~ Anna Magpie: Somewhat tangential but on that topic, one of my favorite papers
https://elifesciences.org/articles/73225
[9/1/26, 14:56:42] ~ manav: Reading
[9/1/26, 15:01:00] Haziq KXHL: i don’t think evolution of evolvability works for two reasons

one// occam’s razor. neo-wallacean evolution is already a minimal mechanism. evolvability adds a meta layer where selection somehow tunes the properties of mutation itself. that’s not something the theory predicts, that’s a rescue move

second/// it encodes intent. for evolvability to be selected, a lineage has to be fitter now because it will generate better variants later. but natural selection has no access to future fitness. neo-wallaceans are very explicit about this. selection only acts on present phenotypes. once you respect that constraint, most evolvability arguments collapse
[9/1/26, 15:01:59] Haziq KXHL: to elaborate on one...
1. random mutation plus selection is too inefficient to explain observed complexity
2. so we posit evolvability, meaning variation is biased toward useful directions
3. but that bias itself has to be produced by evolution
4. which brings us back to the original problem of how blind search produced that bias
[9/1/26, 15:02:10] ~ Anna Magpie: Oh to be clear i don't think this solves it at all
[9/1/26, 15:02:52] ~ Anna Magpie: But it's part of a cluster of ideas around "How is the search space shaped" which I'm very interested in
[9/1/26, 15:03:47] ~ Anna Magpie: Right, point 2 is why this relies on linkage relationships
[9/1/26, 15:04:03] ~ Anna Magpie: "Evolvability" is genes shaping their environment
[9/1/26, 15:12:55] Haziq KXHL: yeah i’m actually not committed to the strongest neo-wallacean axiom. i’m fine relaxing it. i’m open to linkage, group effects, altruism, all of that. ageing in particular makes more sense to me as a lineage-level or altruistic phenomenon than as individual optimisation. so i’m not resisting expanding the ontology of selection

but even granting linkage, the problem with _*evo of evo*_ is the implied search operator. you’re assuming something that already knows how to move toward the wells. stochastic gradient descent doesn’t know where the wells are
[9/1/26, 15:17:13] Haziq KXHL: saying repurposing here is like saying linux scales because copy paste exists 
lol pls do excuse my bits 🙏
[9/1/26, 15:17:14] ~ Anna Magpie: Right, the evo of evo claim would be that there exist robustly good strategies, and genes which force other parts of the genome to implement them will fare better in certain kinds of environments than the ones that don't
[9/1/26, 15:17:58] ~ Anna Magpie: Yea, tbc I thinking what you're pointing at is very much an unsolved problem, I'm just describing some of the ways the search space gets modulated
[9/1/26, 15:32:50] Haziq KXHL: ok let me do due diligence to this pov, because i agree it’s actually interesting and not obviously wrong
[9/1/26, 15:34:25] Haziq KXHL: *first//* this is a big departure from the classic dawkins story we were fed growing up. dawkins-style evolution is dumb. gloriously dumb. that’s the whole selling point. but also, no appeal to authority here cos dawkins is also dumb lol
going from “drunk guy hill-climbing” to “guy who keeps accidentally rediscovering decent inductive biases” is a real shift, but not wrong a priori
[9/1/26, 15:34:56] Haziq KXHL: the issue (i think) is what you inherit once you make that move
[9/1/26, 15:37:30] Haziq KXHL: _*2//*_ the nicely biased operator problem. the moment you say evolution converges to a good search strategy
you immediately hit a brutal exploration vs exploitation tradeoff. what exactly is the bias toward

the space of desirable wells is massive, context dependent, environment specific and time varying. a bias that helps in one ecological regime will actively hurt you in another. so a search operator that is “nicely biased” in general is almost a contradiction. either it’s strongly biased, in which case it overfits and gets stuck or it’s weakly biased in which case it behaves basically like random search and you’re back where you started (FLT / Free lunch theorem kills the goldilock's zone)

FLT angle: there is no universally good search strategy. any optimiser that works well is good because it’s matched to a restricted class of problems. averaged over all landscapes, no strategy beats random search
[9/1/26, 15:39:11] Haziq KXHL: _*third//*_ the explanation still eats its own premise. the original reason to invoke evolvability is to explain how blind search gets anywhere at all. but now the explanation becomes: blind search works because it eventually discovers a really good way to not be blind anymore

ok, sick. how did it do that part

discovering a good search operator is itself a hard search problem. it requires new molecular machinery, new regulatory structure etc etc. and empirically we know how slow that kind of thing is. even something as trivial as a fluorescent protein takes hundreds of millions of years under basically unbiased search. so appealing to evolution discovering a good optimiser just pushes the difficulty up a level, it doesn’t remove it
[9/1/26, 15:55:15] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: What’s this convo about champ? @⁨Haziq KXHL⁩
[9/1/26, 16:03:51] Haziq KXHL: some math that makes me very grateful studying evolution is someone else’s problem
[9/1/26, 16:06:04] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Bruhh 😂🤣
[9/1/26, 16:16:58] ~ Anna Magpie: I wish studying evolution was my problem tbh
[9/1/26, 16:23:50] Haziq KXHL: oh god replicator dynamics why would you do this to me 😭 why are you bringing work into my free time. this is literally what they have me labouring on lol
[9/1/26, 16:24:26] Haziq KXHL: but yes this paper looks awesome and i actually haven’t read it. i totally rate it, defo down for a journal club, hit me up when ur in town!!
[9/1/26, 16:24:45] Haziq KXHL: also pls note i am not a large language model and have not ingested every bioarxiv preprint with 11 citations 😭
[9/1/26, 16:25:40] Haziq KXHL: and tbh we’re all equally cooked on the math. you’re talking to someone who used to do field ecology. i still wake up wondering why i traded rainbow squirrels and hornbills for this 😭
[9/1/26, 16:32:07] ~ Anna Magpie: Wait you used to do fieldwork?
[9/1/26, 16:41:24] Haziq KXHL: yeah in a different lifetime lol. was basically playing temple run IRL until i realised long term career growth is highly contingent on having a pulse
[9/1/26, 16:41:47] Haziq KXHL: weird pivot from field ecology to quantitative and now apparently wet lab soon lol
[9/1/26, 16:44:44] Haziq KXHL: but yeah defo seen things in the field. jungle tiger tracking was fun until i actually got close to one and my soul left my body 😭 few sounds are as spine-chilling as a tiger roaring
[9/1/26, 17:18:58] Haziq KXHL: endosymbiosis and chemical evolution are a separate can of worms, happy to go there later. but even just the information problem alone 😭 let’s just say i take prometheus a lot more unironically now
‎[9/1/26, 17:45:30] Haziq KXHL: ‎image omitted
[9/1/26, 17:46:23] Haziq KXHL: ⬆️ My field pics, damn thing
chased me around for ages tryna kill me
[9/1/26, 18:04:51] Yi Hein: That’s insane, where was this?
[9/1/26, 18:28:30] Haziq KXHL: mostly tropical rainforests in southern india where the tigers live 🐅 
location hush hush 🤐 cos poachers would love to know
‎[9/1/26, 18:31:13] Haziq KXHL: ‎image omitted
[9/1/26, 18:31:21] Haziq KXHL: idk if the tiger footprint is clear but this thing was MASSIVE
[9/1/26, 20:43:27] Haziq KXHL: okkk
the benches have been pressed and the dead have been lifted
i’m ready for story time 2, everyone grab marshmallows and gather round 🔥
[9/1/26, 20:45:39] Haziq KXHL: current state of origin of life research (which we lovingly call OOL): extremely cursed. which is honestly fine… it is probably the hardest question there is so that tracks.

both of the assumptions you mentioned are pretty sus right now. we have already yapped a lot about how even if replicators somehow appear, it is very unclear how they would ever accumulate the information content needed for life.

but the prior step, whether replicators can arise at all, is somehow even worse 😬 it is complicated. and the miller urey stuff that shows up in freshman bio textbooks is really missing the point.

the epistemic bar in this field is incredibly low. a lot of work is basically showing that under some highly contrived lab conditions, you can get biologically relevant molecules, and then completely ignoring how impossible those conditions are in reality or whether prebiotic earth ever had them.

it is kind of like pouring millions of dollars and the best engineers into building an iphone in a high tech facility and then saying “lol we made it, therefore it can also just pop out of the soup”
[9/1/26, 20:49:30] Haziq KXHL: yeah so this is kind of where it stops being a biochemistry or search-theory question and starts being a cosmology one. given those constraints the expected time to get something like complex eukaryotic life blows up to basically zillions under any reasonable 99% credible interval (yes i am Bayesian cope 💁‍♂️).

so sure, it’s not logically impossible but happening on the timescale we actually have, like the age of the universe is vanishingly unlikely. you can rescue it under inflationary cosmology where you get tons of universes and extreme tail events eventually occur.

but this is also where i start getting nervous about shifting epistemic standards. we do not look at a SETI transmission and go “oh it’s probably just a weird multiverse fluctuation”

note to self: aliens aren’t real and they can’t hurt you 😭
[9/1/26, 20:52:04] Haziq KXHL: yeah all of those patch fixes have been proposed. endosymbiosis, HGT, gene duplication, blah blah. they do help explain how already functional systems get recombined or elaborated. but they’re kind of half baked as solutions to the really hard part, which is the origin of genuinely novel, evolutionarily consequential information.

endosymbiosis in particular mostly explains conserved cores. mitochondria work because bacterial machinery already worked. same for a lot of HGT stories. you’re shuffling, integrating and stabilizing existing solutions. that’s not nothing but it’s not free magic either.

what really kills the “life finds a way” framing for me is human evolution. anatomically modern humans are what ~300k years and behaviorally modern humans maybe ~50–70k. even if you’re generous and say ~6 million years since the split from chimps that’s a blink.

and yet a lot of the traits that matter most are driven by non-homologous, non-conserved, not-even-remotely-similar-to-any-close-species proteins and regulatory programs. not tweaks to ancient pathways, not conserved bacterial leftovers. genuinely weird stuff.
[9/1/26, 20:55:04] Haziq KXHL: 😭😭 nooooo not me pls
god not me
i subscribe to a care based epistemology and my methodology is handling living things gently 😆
i was in operations research for a bit which gave me the bad habit of thinking all problems are math problems
[9/1/26, 20:57:33] Haziq KXHL: btw my lil green men allusions aren’t entirely a bit 😭 this is genuinely where origin of life discourse ends up. cronin’s assembly theory is basically a negative result machine that tells you how uncomfortable you should be if you see a molecule of a given complexity in a meteorite or whatever.

tl;dr assembly theory: if a molecule needs a long, specific sequence of steps to exist, random chemistry basically never makes it. life does. so if you see one in the wild you should be extremely suspicious.
[9/1/26, 21:26:04] Yi Hein: who do you think is working on a line of research that is trying to find the fundamental answer to this question?
‎[9/1/26, 21:59:27] Haziq KXHL: wong-et-al-2023-on-the-roles-of-function-and-selection-in-evolving-systems.pdf • ‎11 pages ‎document omitted
[9/1/26, 22:04:49] Haziq KXHL: what ppl seem to be converging on is basically: emergence fairytales are toast.
“complexity just kinda happens” is not doing the work anymore.
[9/1/26, 22:07:27] Haziq KXHL: so instead there’s this move toward positing something like a new physical law. some mysterious force that drives complexity to increase with time. which is already extremely sus because hello?? the second law of thermodynamics exists.. lowkey what you’ve done is smuggle in a maxwell’s demon ( _*God*_ is that you?)
[9/1/26, 22:07:58] Haziq KXHL: this paper is probably the most refined attempt at doing that and the fact that it’s still laughable tells you a lot
[9/1/26, 22:09:17] Haziq KXHL: _*tl;dr of their move:*_
they “rescue” the second law by inventing a new supposedly orthogonal quantity called functional information. entropy doesn’t have to go up or down differently bcos functional information can go up instead. problem solved apparently 😑

except functional information is dumb as hell because it assumes the function of the system is known and then measures how well the system evolves toward that. which is exactly as circular and stupid as it sounds. you’ve baked the teleology straight into the definition and then declared victory
[9/1/26, 22:11:48] Haziq KXHL: genuinely idk if this is even an answerable question. it’s looking pretty bleak at the moment.

unless you pull a Carlo Rovelli, deny the second law of thermodynamics and drag loop quantum gravity into the parking lot to fight abiogenesis directly ☠️
[9/1/26, 22:14:59] Haziq KXHL: also these people were particularly insolent 

theyre already out here publishing pop sci trash about how he’s basically figured out the universe. and i’m like. bro. chill. you are a postdoc with one dumb paper and a medium article. entropy is not impressed
[9/1/26, 22:32:28] Yi Hein: so what are the limits of explainability of evolution? at what point does that explanation still holds and at what point does it breakdown? you mentioned that protein signalling is too complex and fragile to be created by evolution. But for example, in convergent evolution, do you think the adaptation of existing body parts for new function is possible via random mutation?
[9/1/26, 22:34:34] ~ Anna Magpie: My intuition would be that this is something that evo devo explains perfectly acceptably ‎<This message was edited>
[9/1/26, 22:35:20] ~ Anna Magpie: The difficult part is getting to that level of organization in the first place
[9/1/26, 22:36:43] Yi Hein: but there is local minima even in that case right? Like for bats, there is no natural selection benefit to continue developing a wing that can’t fly, and the threshold for a flyable wing is quite high
[9/1/26, 22:37:27] Yi Hein: Ok as @⁨Haziq KXHL⁩ said no one is developing a wing in the active sense but yeah
[9/1/26, 22:45:12] Haziq KXHL: i second @⁨~Anna Magpie⁩ 
repurposing is totally plausible. as Schützenberger said, darwinian evolution works great once you already have the stuff
[9/1/26, 22:57:34] Haziq KXHL: this is actually the kind of problem evo devo has answered relatively well. idk the exact evo devo story for bat wings, but for birds it goes something like this. it probably started as a weird mate choice quirk. female dinos liked some ornamental proto wing thing and via a _Lande-Kirkpatrick style runaway_ *(fancy term for a crazy feedback loop where display traits get more and more decadent for absolutely no good reason)* it turns into this huge elaborate canvas for display. and then et voilà the damn thing turns out to be useful for flying.

evo devo explanations are like this in general. they’re contested and they function more as existence proofs. but i rate this one highly for vibes and also because i’m a big fan of Richard Prum. it’s one of the rare cases where sexual selection plausibly comes before natural selection.
[9/1/26, 23:05:32] Haziq KXHL: all of this is very pretty but it still answers basically nothing. most of evolutionary theory lives at the phenotype level. once you push down to proteins, genotype and information... it’s basically descending dante’s inferno 

you can say ok fine, here was the selection pressure for bats to develop wings. but then ask the real question. what new molecular machinery had to appear to make that possible and how did that show up on this timescale.

the honest answer is kind of “we don’t fully know” and what you’re left with is an unpalatable explanation like 99.99999999 percent of the wing was already there and random mutations just unearthed it. which makes me die a little just typing it.

just think about Pakicetus (cute lil puppy like thing) to modern whales in ~50 million years when a freaking glow stick protein apparently needs ~500 million years.
[9/1/26, 23:26:47] Haziq KXHL: woohoo check out our cool new logo
[9/1/26, 23:25:42] Haziq KXHL: ‎Haziq KXHL changed this group's icon
[9/1/26, 23:46:59] Haziq KXHL: ok final thing lol. lemme say my own research question w.r.t. this whole mess. i probably won’t have the intellectual or time bandwidth to answer it myself but i’ll be eagerly waiting for someone else to. i’ll at least take one astrophysics course to cope.

it just feels like a lot of wildly improbable stuff is happening around here, at home, in this universe. first complexity everywhere. then apparently intelligent life. then potentially a freaking SETI transmission. like hello?? the improbabilities keep compounding.

ok fine inflationary cosmology is actually a legit theory unlike string or loop nonsense and it implies infinitely many universes. beth-0 universes to be precise. shoutout to effective altruists for reminding us of that fun fact.

so maybe we’re just in one of the weird ones. cool.

but then the question that keeps bugging me is this. what if our universe doesn’t just contain a bunch of low probability events but an infinite stack of them. like improbability all the way down. in that case is beth-0 universes even enough to explain what we’re seeing?

basically. what if the multiverse is still underpowered for how cursed this place is.
[10/1/26, 00:31:42] Haziq KXHL: ok this is why i try not to think about this 😭 you’re chilling in NREM1 and then you wake up sweating thinking about cosmology

anyways here’s an infinite stack to sleep on (or not 💀)
* standard model + GR give you continuous fields. “state of the universe” is literally a function over space.
* any such field can be decomposed into Fourier modes. infinitely many of them. orthogonal directions in state space.
* “universe doesn’t catastrophically explode” cashes out as: every mode across every scale stays in bounds for all time (low probability constraint)
* keeping one band sane does nothing for the rest. orthogonality means failure can happen independently in infinitely many directions.

which kind of looks like an infinite stack of low probability constraints that all have to be satisfied at once inside a single universe.

reader discretion tho. i’m not a mathematician or physicist. i study placentas for heaven’s sake.

so before life or intelligence or SETI or whatever fresh nonsense the universe already had to satisfy an infinite conjunction just to stay boring.

beth-0 eats finite miracles. not sure it eats this.

ok goodnight 😴

[10/1/26, 10:28:40] ~ manav: If you think this is an intractable complexity problem then just consider the contingencies that need to fall in place to have a beth 0-universes-generator
[10/1/26, 10:29:19] ~ manav: Like the multiverse itself is not pre-causal right
[10/1/26, 11:16:35] Haziq KXHL: borde-guth-vilenkin theorem: any spacetime with positive average expansion (✅ experimentally verified) is past incomplete. so there’s a t=0 no matter what cosmology you cook up. big bang with its one universe, inflationary with its zillion universes, whatever. so *_yes_* no cosmology is pre-causal in that sense
[10/1/26, 11:19:37] Haziq KXHL: thing is we’re kind of actively encouraged not to talk about those contingencies. like once you ask what’s “before” or “under” the universe or multiverse that’s suddenly not physics anymore. dogma is “don’t ask why or how”, just accept the setup. which is fine, i’m not trying to contest that boundary cos I can’t be bothered honestly 😭
[10/1/26, 11:20:29] Haziq KXHL: so i usually just reason within cosmological constraints as given. my point is even granting inflation plus infinitely many universes, a single universe already has to satisfy an infinite stack of stability constraints just to exist non-catastrophically
[10/1/26, 11:21:55] Haziq KXHL: so i’m not saying “what caused the multiverse” i’m saying “is the multiverse actually enough for how cursed this universe already is”
[10/1/26, 11:26:40] Haziq KXHL: consciousness is the hard problem they said, we’ve got the universe figured out they said 😵‍💫
[10/1/26, 11:30:21] ~ manav: I agree that talking about that sort of thing is not science but it’s convenient that the load bearing part of our leading theory is in principle not induction-apt
[10/1/26, 11:30:41] ~ manav: Hello phlogiston my old friend
[10/1/26, 11:33:38] ~ manav: So is it that there exist physical constraints that are not measurable or that non-physical things necessarily exist
[10/1/26, 11:47:32] Haziq KXHL: totally agree w this. we start doing science at t=0 but the contingencies that make t=0 possible are already settled by then 😭
[10/1/26, 11:57:01] Haziq KXHL: i’m not making any claim about non-physicalism one way or another. but if someone ended up appealing to it after staring at this long enough, i honestly wouldn’t blame them. it’s not like i have a cleaner answer to offer.

at this point it feels less like god-of-the-gaps and more like non-physicalism because the math started sweating
[10/1/26, 12:00:29] Haziq KXHL: if the universe is fields with infinitely many degrees of freedom then “doesn’t catastrophically blow up” is an infinite list of perfectly physical constraints that all have to be satisfied at once. each one is in principle measurable. the weirdness is the infinite conjunction.
[10/1/26, 12:07:13] Haziq KXHL: honestly i think the universe started glitching the moment we stopped treating “complexity” as a purely subjective labeling thing and started noticing that some structures just objectively shouldn’t be there without absurdly long causal chains behind them.
[10/1/26, 12:08:04] Haziq KXHL: complexity as “what we care about” is observer dependent. but then you look at weird freaking crystals or molecules that require a huge number of sequential assembly steps.
[10/1/26, 12:08:21] Haziq KXHL: this is basically what Lee Cronin keeps poking at with assembly theory. certain objects only exist if the universe executed a very specific sequence of steps in the right order. and that starts to feel uncomfortably like foresight
[10/1/26, 12:09:28] Haziq KXHL: it’s not like the crystal knows where it’s going. the space of possible evolutions is so constrained that arriving there implies an insanely non-generic past. and once you notice that “complexity is subjective” stops being very soothing.

like ok cool, no purpose, no goals. but how did the dumb laws manage to stumble into such deep causal corridors over and over again. ‎<This message was edited>
[10/1/26, 12:18:45] ~ manav: This reminds me a lot of this one crank/genius mathematician
[10/1/26, 12:18:50] ~ manav: Wolfgang Smith
[10/1/26, 12:19:35] ~ manav: His whole thing was uniting quantum mechanics with potency/act Aristotelean ontology
[10/1/26, 12:22:51] ~ manav: Forget the specifics but I think this is a parallel problem. Cronin is just trying to avoid the word teleology here. Smith would say that there are some corners of physics where scientific method is poorly served by a scientistic basis and it’s actually less woo-woo to do honest metaphysics
[10/1/26, 12:24:16] Haziq KXHL: “Like other mathematicians such as Marcel-Paul Schützenberger, David Berlinski, and Gian-Carlo Rota, Smith found Neo-Darwinian evolution mathematically impossible.”
🔥🙌❤️
Excerpt from his bio
[10/1/26, 13:46:08] ~ Vlad: ‎~ Vlad left
[10/1/26, 12:48:50] Haziq KXHL: i think smith is taking a more dialectical approach, whereas cronin’s assembly theory is deliberately forensic. no meaning, no teleology. just “this object statistically implies a wildly non-generic past.” once you make that claim precise, the void where explanation should be becomes really loud 😬 and it’s kind of your prerogative whether you just wanna stare into it or fill that with metaphysics
[10/1/26, 12:50:29] Haziq KXHL: the alternative is to keep duct taping on physicalist escape hatches that avoid teleology. like sure maybe there’s another universe that’s way more friendly to complexity where intelligent beings evolved and then seeded us via panspermia. but that just drops the same physical laws that let you posit the multiverse in the first place. the second law sends its regards and the arrow of time is not on board with this plan 😭
[10/1/26, 13:07:29] ~ manav: I think stuffing things behind t=0 and similar cack handed manoeuvres to make physicalism work have their merits though
[10/1/26, 13:19:33] ~ manav: The question is fundamentally one of axiology. Space, time, extension etc are all unintelligible without prior valuation. So naturally we should be like Schutzenberger or Smith or whoever and first establish a regime of judgement and then try to make sense of these things? Im not so sure
[10/1/26, 13:21:49] ~ manav: The thing is that for us humans value is only ever existentially operative under the conditions of finitude. Value is disclosed through orientation, not prior to all orientation. We don’t first apprehend a pure field of value and then decide whether to move; we find ourselves already moving, already implicated, already answerable and only then can we articulate what matters. Axiology for us is always retroactively clarified within a trajectory
[10/1/26, 13:24:33] ~ manav: So I think “honest physicalism” is that I have been thrown into a world and I have some instruments for making sense of it. There might be something prior to this world but I will believe whatever I need to maximise the usefulness of these instruments, i.e. be extremely metaphysically terse so I can participate in this mode of sense-making
[10/1/26, 16:57:43] Haziq KXHL: @⁨Yi Hein⁩ yo EF is camping outside print room cafe rn…. permission to scare them off?
[10/1/26, 16:59:20] Yi Hein: they are advertising on a weekend?
[10/1/26, 16:59:50] Haziq KXHL: yeah bro asking folks to drop out and commit VC backed crimes ‎<This message was edited>
[10/1/26, 17:01:04] Yi Hein: gosh we gotta get them to join KXHL instead
[10/1/26, 17:01:15] Yi Hein: rather than EF
[10/1/26, 17:01:45] Yi Hein: maybe have a sleight of hand on their sign up list
[10/1/26, 17:03:55] Haziq KXHL: crazy how doc just told me to commit a crime but ok
[10/1/26, 17:04:40] Haziq KXHL: crime for good 👍
[10/1/26, 18:21:43] Haziq KXHL: i think there’s another incompleteness problem hiding here… we need time, orientation valuation etc to even run the instruments and then physics immediately turns around and starts dissolving those very notions. relativity eats global time, QFT poisons locality, LQG is like “actually spacetime was a convenience we regret” 
cool cool cool 😮‍💨
[10/1/26, 18:25:54] Haziq KXHL: so there’s a loop… the instrumental stance works only because it inherits a spatiotemporal + axiological scaffold it cannot itself justify. we can be metaphysically terse sure 🤷‍♂️ but that terseness is freeloading hard. you need a path for the meaning to show up and the theory keeps deleting the map
[10/1/26, 18:27:09] Haziq KXHL: not unlike your contention with dennett’s take on consciousness…
[10/1/26, 21:17:11] ~ manav: I actually totally agree with you. As you know I’m a filthy foundationalist
[10/1/26, 21:17:22] ~ manav: But I try to steelman materialism
[10/1/26, 21:26:16] ~ manav: And to some extent it’s important to let go of the need for that scaffold and just freeload with enthusiasm. When Hume demonstrated that induction cannot survive a thoroughgoing skepticism he treated this as a disproof of the skepticism ;)
[10/1/26, 21:31:18] ~ manav: Absolutely, I’m not even 100% sure that this doesn’t just totally collapse into that problem insofar as the final constraint is the validity of the inferences that inform the theories. But then we get into dangerous “everything is the same thing” territory which leads to Kanye West or Himalayan mysticism

[10/1/26, 23:24:54] Haziq KXHL: okkk there’s been way too much origin of life discourse lately so we’re just turning it into a thing

informal AMA style. @⁨~Alp Duygu⁩ will talk about the CISS effect which is a super interesting OOL-adjacent problem. basically biomolecules are homochiral, and it turns out chiral molecules + electron spin + surfaces might actually break symmetry in a physical way which might lowkey be essential for life. but enantiomers are insanely hard to separate in the soup so how the heck did that even happen?? tun tun tun

i will be yapping about the usual nonsense

this is not a journal club or a research presentation. we’re actively trying to make this understandable so pls for the love of god show up

[11/1/26, 09:07:56] ~ Ekjot Singh: Hey everyone 👋
I’m taking on the 75 Hard Challenge — 75 days of daily workouts, clean eating, reading, and discipline — to raise money for a cause that’s really important to me.

I’ve set up a fundraiser to support this, and I’d be incredibly grateful for any support, whether that’s a donation or just sharing the link. Even a small contribution can make a big difference ❤️

Here’s the link to donate or learn more:
https://www.gofundme.com/f/hkj9tz-75-hard-challenge-fundraiser

Thank you so much for the encouragement and support — it honestly means a lot 🙏
[11/1/26, 09:10:06] Haziq KXHL: very cool! what’s the cause you’re supporting?
[11/1/26, 09:34:26] Haziq KXHL: ironic how the cambrian explosion gets used as a kind of explanatory patch for rapid formation of complex life when it was actually the thing that made me rage quit this field.

like ok we all know the story. darwin expects continuity in the fossil record. we see sudden complex structures and missing intermediates so we say fine probably bad sampling. that’s darwin’s artefact hypothesis "we’ll find the precursors eventually"

then we don’t so we pivot... ok maybe pre cambrian life was too soft to fossilise so of course we’re missing it (see what we did there? bend data to fit hypothesis. we're smart like that 😇)

and then Yin et al 2007 _Nature_ go and find jellycat level soft tiny pre cambrian embryos in the doushantuo formation sitting neatly beneath the cambrian. meaning soft bodied stuff *_does_* preserve when it exists 

i quit 🪦

[11/1/26, 13:02:24] ~ Adam: sure
[11/1/26, 13:41:29] Haziq KXHL: why ada 😭 why at t minus 48 hours
i was just reviewing a bunch of personal statements for a community teaching thing but i can take a look at one more
also interesting choice consulting humans when AI is right there 👀
[11/1/26, 13:44:08] ~ Ada Ge: you don't use up my api limits <3

‎[11/1/26, 16:30:40] Yi Hein: ✨Weekly Featured Project ✨
This week, we are featuring, @⁨Hera KXHL⁩’s *Script Reader*!

*The idea*
“As a drama techie, I've witnessed too many actors delaying rehearsals by forgetting their lines and experienced plenty of second-hand embarrassment. This tool helps actors rehearse scripts by serving as a judgment-free roleplay partner.” ‎video omitted
[11/1/26, 16:31:23] Yi Hein: ^ come join our hack sessions and work on projects to get featured!
[11/1/26, 17:24:00] Haziq KXHL: round of applause for @⁨Hera KXHL⁩ for being the only person in hack club who remembered the “build” part
[11/1/26, 17:26:28] Haziq KXHL: also r u happy to do a founder fireside / AMA on the GC? we'll be asking questions like VCs who are pretending not to be impressed
[11/1/26, 17:57:27] Haziq KXHL: omg she’s not even coming to demo day 😭 two clarifications pls:
* fate of alex & taylor. still an item or 👀
* can you explain the bold choice to cast an alex as the toxic boyfriend when we have multiple alexes present
[11/1/26, 19:34:17] Hera KXHL: i’m not prepared but that sound really fun
[11/1/26, 19:37:36] ~ Alex Pylypenko: As an Alex, I thank you for your support in this difficult time.
[11/1/26, 19:49:35] Haziq KXHL: as the saying goes: not all alexes but somehow always an alex 🤔
[11/1/26, 19:50:56] Haziq KXHL: incredible. please note that by expressing excitement you have opted into Being Turned Into A Bit™️. no refunds.
[11/1/26, 19:51:03] Haziq KXHL: jk jk (legal made me say this)
[11/1/26, 19:51:34] Haziq KXHL: what was the hardest part of building it so far?
[11/1/26, 19:52:00] Haziq KXHL: also opening the floor for questions, pls be nice (or at least creative)
‎[11/1/26, 23:37:51] Haziq KXHL: so the answer to the evolution problem might actually come from some pretty weird biology... and trust me when i say it does not get weirder than this. consider this story time 3 🏕️ ‎image omitted
[11/1/26, 23:45:38] Haziq KXHL: so ok obviously neo-darwinism with its pathetic stochastic search operator over DNA space is the worst theory of the evolution... except for all the others which are even more cursed cos for the love of god we _*DO NOT*_ want a spooky sentient search operator 👻
so thats why i rate dawkins highly even though he looks like a fool when he claims universal darwinism cos it fails big time in the cambrian explosion. *20 new phyla* for heavens sake, ediacaran (period just before cambrian) had 4 phyla in the best case which can _*only specialise*_, not take a U-turn. 
an eagle can change its beak. it can’t revert back to unicellular and then speciate into a spider. be serious.
[11/1/26, 23:47:23] Haziq KXHL: but if only we could actually search over phenotype space (body plans, control policies etc etc) instead. 😭 but you guessed it too lamarckian. illegal. i keep reaching for the top shelf and i’m still five foot something
[11/1/26, 23:47:56] Haziq KXHL: but hold your horses. because there is one theory with strong empirics that predicts a converging lamarckian process and not as a duct taped patch fix. like it falls out of the system in a honest way
[11/1/26, 23:48:13] Haziq KXHL: enter michael levin.
[11/1/26, 23:49:36] Haziq KXHL: the image above is not photoshop (https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/16/11/26065). they achieved interspecies morphological interconversion in planaria without necessarily altering the genome. same dna but different stable body plans. wait what? 😭 the entire dogma of developmental biology was that body plans are germline encoded. so what the hell even is this.
[11/1/26, 23:51:21] Haziq KXHL: two words: bioelectric patterning. turns out this stuff has top down control over phenotype. they also made two headed planarians by modulating bioelectric patterns which is insane. levin calls this a morphogenetic latent space which organisms can explore within a single lifetime (very much lamarckian) via what he calls natural induction and then natural selection just fixes the fittest of those states as stable attractors _*using genetics*_
[11/1/26, 23:51:26] ~ Elma : Hey guys
[11/1/26, 23:51:37] ~ Elma : sorry to interrupt your flow haziq
[11/1/26, 23:51:43] ~ Elma : But I’m in a bit of a pickle
[11/1/26, 23:51:46] Haziq KXHL: nw nw
[11/1/26, 23:52:13] Haziq KXHL: whats up? do tell, how can we help?
[11/1/26, 23:52:27] ~ Elma : Okok
[11/1/26, 23:52:29] ~ Elma : So
[11/1/26, 23:52:51] ~ Elma : lowkey sounds so trivial but it’s acc stressing me out now
[11/1/26, 23:52:59] ~ Elma : Obviously with hosting events
[11/1/26, 23:53:03] ~ Elma : You need venues
[11/1/26, 23:53:18] ~ Elma : And I’m lowkey spending a couple hundred to rent these spaces
[11/1/26, 23:53:19] Haziq KXHL: happens to the best of us, dont worry abt it
[11/1/26, 23:53:34] ~ Elma : And it’s just not sustainable at all
[11/1/26, 23:54:02] ~ Elma : So I was wondering if anyone had any recs on what to do in these situations?
[11/1/26, 23:54:29] ~ Elma : I have done free partnerships w unis and there are lovely ppl that are happy to host us
[11/1/26, 23:54:36] ~ Elma : But these are one off ygm?
[11/1/26, 23:55:01] ~ Elma : Like it’s not long term
[11/1/26, 23:55:45] Haziq KXHL: ok i have no expertise in this area but what i can do is temporarily halt all KXHL activities and bickering till someone provides a clever solution. All KXHL brainpower is hereby dedicated to this ‎<This message was edited>
[11/1/26, 23:56:06] ~ Elma : Hahahaha appreciate this
[11/1/26, 23:56:15] ~ Elma : Idk if this will summon them 😩
[11/1/26, 23:56:27] Haziq KXHL: dw we'll turn it into a hackathon if needed
[11/1/26, 23:57:02] ~ Elma : But I think the corps would be down to host us for free but it’s just that these are socials so it’s hard to propose a value prop but I haven’t stressed the method tbf
[11/1/26, 23:57:17] ~ Elma : The other option is to get in touch with uni SU’s
[11/1/26, 23:57:22] Haziq KXHL: @⁨~Tuhan Sapumanage⁩ always has something useful to say in these situations...
[11/1/26, 23:57:27] ~ Elma : But frickin helll so hard to speak to a human
[11/1/26, 23:57:35] ~ Elma : what do they do?
[11/1/26, 23:57:48] ~ Elma : Haziq do u go ucl?
[11/1/26, 23:57:54] Haziq KXHL: yesssss
[11/1/26, 23:58:17] ~ Elma : do you guys have a SU stakeholder?
[11/1/26, 23:58:22] ~ Elma : Nicee
[11/1/26, 23:58:28] ~ Elma : Not a president
[11/1/26, 23:58:35] ~ Elma : But someone more senior
[11/1/26, 23:58:39] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Hahaha what’s the question again? 😂
[11/1/26, 23:58:46] Haziq KXHL: generally a very smart guy lol, sorta person who works at McKinsey and has solutions to all problems ‎<This message was edited>
[11/1/26, 23:59:05] ~ Elma : Ah a consultant just what we need
[11/1/26, 23:59:13] ~ Elma : Ok so basically
[11/1/26, 23:59:25] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Should enclose this with my application to McK QB 🤣
[11/1/26, 23:59:40] ~ Elma : I own a social members club and I spend quite a lot on renting spaces
[11/1/26, 23:59:57] ~ Elma : And I want something long term to reduce overheards completely
[12/1/26, 00:00:00] ~ Elma : Ideally nill
[12/1/26, 00:00:12] ~ Elma : Weve done events with uni societies before
[12/1/26, 00:00:27] ~ Elma : But it’s not a long term strategy as we can’t keep doing partnerships
[12/1/26, 00:00:42] ~ Elma : Unless we strike a partnership w the actual institution
[12/1/26, 00:00:46] ~ Elma : Any ideas?
[12/1/26, 00:01:00] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Models I’ve seen before, either public places or unpopular bars (bonus: they actually give you a cut from drink the sales too)
[12/1/26, 00:01:41] ~ Elma : yhh I think weve tried community centres etc but they charge
[12/1/26, 00:01:45] ~ Elma : So do churches
[12/1/26, 00:01:54] ~ Elma : Bars I wouldnt do
[12/1/26, 00:01:55] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Bars/pubs?
[12/1/26, 00:02:00] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: How many of you are involved?
[12/1/26, 00:02:05] ~ Elma : Muslim 😩
[12/1/26, 00:02:12] ~ Elma : Wdym as in members?
[12/1/26, 00:02:21] ~ Elma : Events usually are avg 25 ppl
[12/1/26, 00:02:25] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Got it
[12/1/26, 00:02:27] ~ Elma : Had 35 at the last one
[12/1/26, 00:02:37] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Wellll bars are the London way to do it 😂
[12/1/26, 00:02:40] ~ Elma : Can someone explain the stakeholder map for unis
[12/1/26, 00:02:40] Haziq KXHL: lol no sorry this is a hack club, no one here has that level of soft skills or political acumen 🫠
[12/1/26, 00:02:42] ~ Elma : Nahhh
[12/1/26, 00:03:06] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: What are these events about again?
[12/1/26, 00:03:20] ~ Elma : Surely someone has better business accumen than me 😩 happy to lose
[12/1/26, 00:03:33] ~ Elma : Socials for apprentices/young professionals
[12/1/26, 00:03:34] Haziq KXHL: presidents can book spaces at UCL but thats about it, no one else has access to the booking system
[12/1/26, 00:03:38] ~ Elma : It’s like chill networking
[12/1/26, 00:04:08] Haziq KXHL: could always do it outdoor and call it "chilly" networking
[12/1/26, 00:04:11] ~ Elma : Ah I see and Yh I figured from our last collab w ucl acs
[12/1/26, 00:04:48] Haziq KXHL: thats the sorta solutions you get from McKinsey ngl
[12/1/26, 00:05:00] ~ Elma : Ok final q
[12/1/26, 00:05:10] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: And the participants are usually like uni students (are they all UCL?)
[12/1/26, 00:05:21] ~ Elma : Can anybody make an educated guess on who the SU president liases with within the institution?
[12/1/26, 00:05:23] ~ manav: Have you considered local libraries? Ones with computer spaces are often hireable for public interest events ‎<This message was edited>

[12/1/26, 00:06:10] ~ manav: Perhaps for a fee but it should be nominal
[12/1/26, 00:06:34] ~ Elma : Hmm if it looks decent could be a shout
[12/1/26, 00:06:40] ~ Elma : Decent interim fix
[12/1/26, 00:06:48] Haziq KXHL: gosh we use libraries for KXHL events and its a nightmare. never enough chairs, gotta be quiet etc etc
[12/1/26, 00:06:59] ~ Elma : Question of the week geniuses!!!
[12/1/26, 00:07:22] Haziq KXHL: no no wait, doesnt have to be SU president
[12/1/26, 00:07:27] ~ Elma : Yh it’s too risky for a big social ngl
[12/1/26, 00:07:28] Haziq KXHL: can be the president of any soc
[12/1/26, 00:07:41] ~ Elma : Yes I know re booking I’ve done collabs
[12/1/26, 00:07:43] ~ Elma : I meant
[12/1/26, 00:07:48] ~ Elma : I need the stakeholder role
[12/1/26, 00:07:55] ~ Elma : That’s who u propose ur business to
[12/1/26, 00:07:59] ~ Elma : Not a student leader
[12/1/26, 00:08:06] ~ Elma : They don’t have decision making power
[12/1/26, 00:08:31] Haziq KXHL: oh i thought you could find an inactive and dysfunctional soc with a broke as hell president and bribe him with lunch money
[12/1/26, 00:08:42] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: I’m guessing Tim/Gerard?
[12/1/26, 00:08:49] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Like their function
[12/1/26, 00:08:51] Haziq KXHL: now thats a BCG level solution
[12/1/26, 00:08:51] ~ Elma : Considering it 😩
[12/1/26, 00:08:55] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Are they all UCL students?
[12/1/26, 00:09:08] ~ manav: Yeah tbh we should all try to come up with a better solution for the third spaces problem. They’re all shit. It’s impossible to coordinate an event without some sort of ad hoc garbage solution and “professional workspaces” are totally priced out for anyone who doesn’t have actual funding
[12/1/26, 00:09:09] ~ Elma : What uni do u go tuhan?
[12/1/26, 00:09:15] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: UCL
[12/1/26, 00:09:36] ~ Elma : Right this is a universal issue and I’m sure kxcl have it too
[12/1/26, 00:09:52] ~ manav: I’ve had this experience even at early stage funded startups. I had to pitch to KV from an IET quiet study room
[12/1/26, 00:09:52] ~ Elma : Ah okay perf what does Tim do?
[12/1/26, 00:10:00] ~ Elma : My gosh
[12/1/26, 00:10:10] ~ Elma : Like it’s just horrific
[12/1/26, 00:10:28] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: They handle the events and stuff done along with the institution
[12/1/26, 00:10:31] ~ Suhas: If you're able to pay, the UCL ioe rents out space for these kinds of thing a lot
[12/1/26, 00:10:43] ~ Elma : How much?
[12/1/26, 00:10:47] ~ Suhas: If you aren't then the best bet might be convincing a society president to book spaces in the IOE for you
[12/1/26, 00:10:58] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: But idk if it works if it’s at least not predominately UCL
[12/1/26, 00:11:01] ~ Suhas: But I'm not super sure if it's easy to smuggle in that many non UCL students to the IOE regularly
[12/1/26, 00:11:02] ~ Elma : Money is a bottle neck bc we’re spending hundreds a month
[12/1/26, 00:11:18] ~ Elma : Yh I don’t wanna smuggle I’d rather speak to them directly
[12/1/26, 00:11:23] ~ manav: Does it need to be a professional space Elma? Like how formal/casual are these events
[12/1/26, 00:11:41] ~ manav: Like could you do it in UCL canteen or something
[12/1/26, 00:11:45] ~ manav: If it’s chill networking
[12/1/26, 00:12:10] Haziq KXHL: i rate this, refractory is huge and mostly empty cos the food is trash
[12/1/26, 00:12:12] ~ Elma : Essentially the proposition is students get to network with our members (they’re top 1% of corp professionals so it’s a chill way to network and for our professionals to make friends)
[12/1/26, 00:12:20] ~ Elma : They’re pretty chill usually
[12/1/26, 00:12:23] ~ manav: Yeah it’s empty every evening
[12/1/26, 00:12:28] ~ Elma : Honestly yeah
[12/1/26, 00:12:35] Haziq KXHL: *refectory
refractory lol medical brainrot
[12/1/26, 00:12:36] ~ Elma : Oooooo
[12/1/26, 00:12:43] ~ Elma : We might be onto something ngl
[12/1/26, 00:13:07] ~ Elma : But some events are more grand
[12/1/26, 00:13:24] ~ manav: I think you’ll have to hire spaces for this tbh
[12/1/26, 00:13:25] Haziq KXHL: yeah we use it all the time for KXHL, its acc very chaos tolerant
[12/1/26, 00:13:33] ~ manav: You guys ran into me there lol
[12/1/26, 00:13:41] ~ Elma : The imperial pitch collab event is gna be our biggest yet and hosted by one of my fave angel investors - but usually it’s pretty chill
[12/1/26, 00:14:01] ~ manav: Ok wait one more idea
[12/1/26, 00:14:02] ~ Elma : Can u believe this was free 😂and easier???
[12/1/26, 00:14:14] ~ Elma : Ok let’s hear it
[12/1/26, 00:14:18] ~ manav: Have you heard of newspeak house
[12/1/26, 00:14:23] ~ Elma : Nope
[12/1/26, 00:14:37] ~ manav: https://newspeak.house/
[12/1/26, 00:14:53] Haziq KXHL: wowww ok idk if big time investor will rate our humble refectory highly
[12/1/26, 00:14:59] ~ manav: Look into this. Tech/EA/rationalist/online twitter people space
[12/1/26, 00:15:16] ~ Elma : Oh wow tjis looks sick
[12/1/26, 00:15:41] ~ Elma : It COULD fit into their programme if I do a formal proposal
[12/1/26, 00:15:56] ~ Elma : She lowkey chill ash
[12/1/26, 00:16:13] ~ Elma : Ok manav you are bright
[12/1/26, 00:16:18] ~ manav: Email them and make generous use of the word orthogonal
[12/1/26, 00:16:26] ~ Elma : This is progress
[12/1/26, 00:16:35] Haziq KXHL: yeah i mean if you could cleverly add shrimp sympathy into the picture that could work
[12/1/26, 00:16:40] ~ manav: I see you Suhas. Bro has seen some shit
[12/1/26, 00:16:56] ~ Elma : Girl idk what word is it’s giving dentist
[12/1/26, 00:17:05] ~ Elma : LOOOOL
[12/1/26, 00:17:07] Haziq KXHL: dont serve any shrimp canapes tho, they'll cry
[12/1/26, 00:17:16] ~ Elma : Are they vegan?
[12/1/26, 00:17:19] ~ manav: This feels more post-rat coded
[12/1/26, 00:17:24] ~ manav: This space I mean
[12/1/26, 00:17:26] ~ manav: Idk tho
[12/1/26, 00:17:50] ~ manav: Idk if they care that much about shrimp
[12/1/26, 00:18:08] Haziq KXHL: not really, they just dont draw line between shrimp and mum
[12/1/26, 00:18:35] ~ Elma : right okay
[12/1/26, 00:18:41] ~ Elma : The RSA seem lovely
[12/1/26, 00:18:48] ~ Elma : They host lots of free events
[12/1/26, 00:19:00] ~ Elma : But the hire fee is MAD
[12/1/26, 00:19:24] ~ Elma : Ok giys thank you for all ur help this was good brainstorming
[12/1/26, 00:19:53] Haziq KXHL: also UCL has lot of underground marxist clubs (absolutely not part of any, i observe from a distance only), theyre known for having sketchy spaces here and there
[12/1/26, 00:20:10] ~ Elma : If my team weren’t dragging me to watch football I’d come to the next sesh 😩 hopefully see yall at one of my events atp
[12/1/26, 00:20:16] ~ Elma : Ah!
[12/1/26, 00:20:47] ~ Elma : Interesting to know
[12/1/26, 00:21:50] Haziq KXHL: 🙋‍♂️ i rate this btw, id never attend if it was in any alcohol-adjacent spaces
[12/1/26, 00:22:43] ~ manav: Lmfao
[12/1/26, 00:22:56] Haziq KXHL: "circling back" as some would say...
idk about you all but this is absolutely not the biology i saw on the billboard and signed up for. but i’m all the way here for this kind of crazy
[12/1/26, 00:23:12] ~ manav: Hey Marxist Soc can we have a room for some VC events
[12/1/26, 00:24:27] Haziq KXHL: technically it is redistribution of wealth to a broke founder so there is an argument to be made...
[12/1/26, 00:27:07] Haziq KXHL: hope to see all of you in our upcoming _*totally awesome*_ OOL seminar btw, dont bail
[12/1/26, 00:27:25] ~ manav: Ok wait
[12/1/26, 00:27:30] ~ manav: Wrt this
[12/1/26, 00:28:13] Haziq KXHL: tun tun tun (objection incoming 😆)
[12/1/26, 00:29:19] ~ manav: Sometimes I feel like the dichotomy between Darwin and Lamarck is not AS extreme as made out to be. Like piRNAs and CRISPR in prokaryotes are kind of Lamarckian right
[12/1/26, 00:29:37] ~ manav: Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is dubious
[12/1/26, 00:29:49] ~ manav: But in principle that is also kind of lamarckian
[12/1/26, 00:31:06] ~ manav: In another life I was really into holobionts but kind of backed out once microbiome research got totally astroturfed by nutrition “science” nonsense. But there is almost necessarily something to it
[12/1/26, 00:32:52] Haziq KXHL: its making a comeback fortunately
this is so cracked: https://www.neobetherapeutics.com/
[12/1/26, 00:33:43] ~ manav: Like something has to tie together the fact that lactose tolerance on a population level is genetic but individuals can brute force tolerance lol
[12/1/26, 00:34:36] ~ manav: Is it more parsimonious to put forward some inheritable mechanism of interchange between behaviour and genome or to think of “multiple tolerances”
[12/1/26, 00:35:08] ~ manav: Each river of milk leads to the great ocean of tolerance…
[12/1/26, 00:39:11] Haziq KXHL: yeah i think that’s basically the point tbh. it’s not darwin vs lamarck. it’s this weird handshake between natural induction and natural selection. stuff figures itself out at the phenotype level first then selection comes in later like ok cool we’re keeping that.
[12/1/26, 00:39:38] Haziq KXHL: bioelectric patterning seems to handle the morphological adaptation. metabolism feels more like a microbiome hack. different layers solving problems in their own janky ways.
[12/1/26, 00:40:15] Haziq KXHL: in all of these cases the genome’s job is basically to fossilise whatever ended up working. selection as memory, not imagination.
[12/1/26, 00:40:25] Haziq KXHL: https://royalsocietypublishing.org/rsfs/article/15/6/20250025/366156/Evolution-by-natural-induction
[12/1/26, 00:47:39] Haziq KXHL: yessss but this is also where the unease creeps back in lol. even if you buy natural induction at each layer... you still have this structured contingent information problem lurking everywhere
[12/1/26, 00:48:19] Haziq KXHL: like ok morphology lives in a morphogenetic latent space instead of dna space. fine. but that space is plausibly higher dimensional not lower. and yet the regions organisms actually explore are insanely useful, coherent etc etc
[12/1/26, 00:50:46] Haziq KXHL: lactose tolerance... an individual can brute force tolerance by shifting their microbiome. ok. but what does that actually mean?? it means there exists a space of possible microbial communities, metabolic pathways etc. and the host plus microbes somehow navigates that space and lands in a configuration that is useful. it digests lactose without poisoning you doesn’t collapse into dysbiosis, doesn’t starve other essential pathways etc etc
[12/1/26, 00:53:07] Haziq KXHL: that space is enormous nd combinatorially disgusting. yet the trajectories the system actually explores are very narrow and very forgiving. if you drop that structure catastrophe becomes common. most nearby configurations would give you dysbiosis, immune freakouts, toxic intermediates, pain pain and death ‎<This message was edited>
[12/1/26, 00:55:06] Haziq KXHL: then search becomes intractable again. you’re back to random walks in a space where almost everything kills you.

so the fact that lactose tolerance is even brute forceable tells you the metabolic space is already weirdly forgiving. local moves tend to land you somewhere “ok enough” rather than dead. we dont get that for free, that’s a massive hidden constraint
[12/1/26, 00:56:28] Haziq KXHL: im like cool you gave me another map. but why does every freaking map want life to exist??
[12/1/26, 01:04:15] Haziq KXHL: lamarck’s giraffe somehow “decided” to grow its neck instead of say... elongating its toenails and calling it a day
thats the problem
[12/1/26, 01:08:25] ~ manav: Wait wait wait
[12/1/26, 01:08:36] ~ manav: Isn’t this a bit “wondrous hole in ground shaped perfectly to fit puddle” ‎<This message was edited>
[12/1/26, 01:09:46] ~ manav: The capacity to tolerate lactose is an established configuration that may have been lost in certain populations as their diets rendered it vestigial
[12/1/26, 01:10:25] ~ manav: In this limited sense we are forcing a movement from one attractor state to another and I don’t see how this implies fractal complexity
[12/1/26, 01:10:46] ~ manav: How these useful attractor states are won in the first place is a different question and susceptible to your search space problem
[12/1/26, 01:11:09] ~ manav: But I’m not so sure we can stick on a second order here
[12/1/26, 01:12:26] ~ manav: The idea that this is possible and has genetic basis is just…antagonistic pleiotropy
[12/1/26, 01:12:49] Haziq KXHL: my claim is just that this “second order” thing is not optional. once you lean on attractors to save induction you’ve already assumed a landscape where useful basins exist and are reachable without catastrophe.
[12/1/26, 01:13:16] Haziq KXHL: so i’m not saying lactose tolerance implies fractal complexity. i’m saying the existence of a nice attractor landscape at each layer is exactly where the structured contingency problem lives whether you call it first order or second order.
[12/1/26, 01:13:28] ~ manav: Yeah I agree that it’s just one problem
[12/1/26, 01:13:46] ~ manav: This is a bit of an infohazard because it’s not obvious to me where the structured contingency problem stops
[12/1/26, 01:14:13] ~ manav: Biology is such an arbitrary cutoff point
[12/1/26, 01:14:51] Haziq KXHL: levin would agree with you on that one, big proponent of pan-psychism
[12/1/26, 01:15:41] Haziq KXHL: in fact collaborating with our very own Friston to "prove" everything is basically conscious / living / whatever
[12/1/26, 01:16:02] ~ manav: We are in territory that is so far away from respectable science but I frankly do not have the horsepower to mount a serious critique of structured contingency ‎<This message was edited>
[12/1/26, 01:16:03] Haziq KXHL: where does it stop, do you think? or is it an actual regress?
[12/1/26, 01:16:30] ~ manav: Regresses are only tolerable under linearity
[12/1/26, 01:17:08] Haziq KXHL: https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2310223120
i mean...
[12/1/26, 01:17:19] ~ manav: I.e. I can sustain an infinite regress in hilbert’s hotel given ordinality
[12/1/26, 01:17:30] Haziq KXHL: also see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_theory
[12/1/26, 01:17:42] ~ manav: If I have a row of dominoes and knock over the first one and then immediately remove it everything is fine
[12/1/26, 01:17:49] ~ manav: So in principle regress is tolerable
[12/1/26, 01:18:02] ~ manav: But hierarchical regresses are vicious
[12/1/26, 01:20:51] ~ manav: Hierarchical in the sense of “Haziq is sitting in a chair right now and the chair is holding him up; the chair itself is held up by the floor; floor by steel reinforced foundations; etc etc unto some final basis”. The reason we cannot tolerate this regress is because the chair itself possesses no causal power
[12/1/26, 01:20:55] ~ manav: It borrows it from the prior rung
[12/1/26, 01:21:26] ~ manav: Hence you have to account for an persistent final basis
[12/1/26, 01:22:51] ~ manav: I think this is a good way of characterising this problem is because these spaces operate contemporaneously
[12/1/26, 01:23:24] Haziq KXHL: ok i actually can’t see anymore words are floating officially hit ~72 hours no sleep. will get back to this asap 😭 sorry for not being a sport 🙏
[12/1/26, 01:23:38] ~ manav: Bro wyd go to bed
[12/1/26, 01:23:42] ~ manav: Why are you so sleep deprived
[12/1/26, 01:24:18] Haziq KXHL: new gig, gotta grok placenta in 10 days or im cooked
[12/1/26, 01:25:47] ~ manav: Look at my biologist dawg he thinks multiple consecutive all nighters are positive sum
[12/1/26, 01:29:42] Haziq KXHL: it’s called externalising costs onto future me
[12/1/26, 01:30:12] ~ manav: Sorry to be a scold but you’d probably encode more and faster if you got 7 hours a night
[12/1/26, 01:30:48] ~ manav: Unfashionable thing to say in a hack lab. Apologies it’s my inner medic
[12/1/26, 01:32:19] Haziq KXHL: ok doc 😭 duly noted. also tragic update i dont even get paid for this
[12/1/26, 04:50:38] Yi Hein: Guys, in school, why are we taught concepts and understand the principles before doing problem sets. But AI does loads of problem sets before understanding concepts? It’s almost like we hacked the generalisation process with just words from the teacher, and problem sets just teaches us how to apply those concepts to solidity it.
[12/1/26, 07:36:19] Haziq KXHL: my point is weaker and more local. we can raise the structured contingency objection without needing to posit or solve a final basis. you don’t have to run the regress all the way down to make the problem bite
[12/1/26, 07:39:03] Haziq KXHL: by structured or contingent information we mean states that aren’t forced by the dynamics.

game of life, turing patterns, gray scott etc are the easy case. fix the rules and let it run... et voila patterns fall out automatically

life doesn’t look like that. you get very specific states where if you rerun history slightly you don get a nearby cousin... you get something else or nothing.

this is what assembly theory and functional information stuff are trying to put numbers on. we dont care where the structure comes from
 just the fact that it’s real and non generic.
[12/1/26, 07:41:26] Haziq KXHL: also this is the same move people are making in SETI. not “is it complex” but “how wow is this” i.e. how non generic, how many specific steps had to line up, could this plausibly fall out of blind dynamics or does it scream particular history etc
[12/1/26, 07:41:41] Haziq KXHL: all trying to formalise the same intuition: measuring the gap between stuff that just happens and stuff that statistically implies something worked really hard to get here.
[12/1/26, 07:42:30] Haziq KXHL: https://youtu.be/WqYRMmlZmhM?si=kL9uS2Iu0R3_-O4o
[12/1/26, 07:51:06] Haziq KXHL: also there’s a thermo angle... it’s not just “systems locally decreasing entropy but exporting heat” like ice cubes

structured information seems to want energy too. life sits in these higher energy highly organised states that also somehow keep entropy low locally. literallly shouldnt happen

energy-information equivalence is also suggestive. storing or maintaining information literally costs work. bits aren’t free. the more specific and structured the state the more energy you have to keep pumping in to stop it from decaying.

this isn’t “order from heat flow”. it’s order that has to be actively paid for.

it really feels like the overton window is shifting from “lol complexity happens” to “ok why is this so expensive to maintain by accident”
[12/1/26, 11:10:07] Haziq KXHL: love how im into origin of life and the only thing evolving rn is my unemployment plan 💀 shoutout @⁨~Tuhan Sapumanage⁩ for immediately dming me “best countries for jobless benefits”, looks like im taking my talents to portugal
[12/1/26, 11:14:48] Haziq KXHL: but this field is the love of my life even tho i spend most of my time working on the origin of life in the sense of how the baby gets made. turns out they lied to us it’s not the storks guys. devastated i wasted my early career on field ecology chasing them
[12/1/26, 11:23:45] Haziq KXHL: also lil bit of self-incriminating hack club anthropology... im realising were all using the mereological sum of our academic interests as a substitute for a personality. if anyone external to this circus is here pls rate how sad this is in a scale of 1 to 10. if it’s above the feigenbaum constant we start an NGO for our feelings (or lack thereof)
[12/1/26, 11:36:13] Haziq KXHL: @⁨~Elma ⁩ heres one more idea for you btw, im really into art and keep noticing that lot of these niche galleries and collectives are literally begging for footfall. like no one wants to see their schizophrenic newspaper mosaics that’s supposed to give you a window into your personality. if you bring investors etc thats a win win cos these places have the sorta flair youre looking for
[12/1/26, 11:40:56] ~ Elma : Lowkey you’re onto something
[12/1/26, 11:41:02] ~ Elma : Wdym by footfall?
[12/1/26, 11:41:52] ~ Elma : Galleries would be perf for panels etc and I think most social investors/entrepreneurs/anti AI ppl love what I’m doing bc it’s human centric
[12/1/26, 11:42:29] Haziq KXHL: i mean like actual humans showing up. attention momentum social media posts. the art cant sell if no one ever sees it
[12/1/26, 11:45:31] ~ Elma : Ahhh got you got you
[12/1/26, 11:46:09] ~ Elma : Invite some wealthy senior stakeholders at the corps
[12/1/26, 11:46:18] ~ Elma : They’re sm more accessible
[12/1/26, 11:46:21] ~ Elma : Anywaus giys
[12/1/26, 11:46:48] ~ Elma : How do you guys destimulate after going through copious amounts of stress?
[12/1/26, 11:47:09] ~ Elma : Lowkey I should get my adhd meds yesterday
[12/1/26, 12:03:16] Haziq KXHL: interesting that after witnessing all of this you still thought we were the right people to ask
[12/1/26, 12:04:01] ~ Elma : You guys seem to have a lot of commitments? Chat am I wrong 😬
[12/1/26, 12:05:19] Haziq KXHL: the dogma has been top down control of stimulation. we reject that hegemony. we believe in bottom up control aka body glitches
[12/1/26, 12:05:23] Hera KXHL: santander work cafés could be a space though haven’t been inside myself
[12/1/26, 12:05:44] Hera KXHL: for me it’s greenspace
[12/1/26, 12:06:02] Hera KXHL: i walk in loops around the gardens until i feel better
[12/1/26, 12:06:10] ~ Elma : Ooooo
[12/1/26, 12:06:16] ~ Elma : This works for me too acc
[12/1/26, 12:06:20] ~ Elma : I just don’t do it much
[12/1/26, 12:06:35] ~ Elma : I have a chronic pacing issue that my family hate
[12/1/26, 12:06:40] ~ Keanu: hey guys. sorry to disturb your awesome yap - keep on yapping. Idk if anyone here is interested in going to hackathons but tickets for ICHack (imperial college london's hackathon & the biggest and most hype in the UK) are dropping today at 5pm. if yall want a ticket id set an alarm for 4.45pm as they drop at 5pm sharp today.

heres the link where they'll drop
https://ticketing.ichack.org/events/ichack26/2008221

here is a youtube video of me speedrunning getting a ticket last friday so yall can mentally prepare like an F1 race driver - trust me, you gotta be FAST asf they sold out 300 or so tickets in 20 seconds last friday (by my guess)  https://youtu.be/L6YPGysLQxc
[12/1/26, 12:06:43] ~ Elma : So I’ve taken it outside
[12/1/26, 12:07:08] ~ Elma : Loveee that
[12/1/26, 12:07:28] Hera KXHL: hahah
[12/1/26, 12:07:28] Haziq KXHL: some of us here lowkey swear by our beta blockers
[12/1/26, 12:07:38] ~ Elma : Oh my
[12/1/26, 12:07:43] ~ Alex Pylypenko: your guess is plainly wrong
the website got 70,000 clicks, and they sold out 300 tickets. I opened the website at 4:59, and kept refreshing, and it kept saying "tickets not available", then within a second (literally) it said "tickets sold out"
[12/1/26, 12:07:59] Hera KXHL: should i skip my 5pm lecture
[12/1/26, 12:09:26] ~ Keanu: yeah they didnt actually enable ppl to sign up for tickets until like 5:00:10 or something
[12/1/26, 12:09:36] ~ Keanu: i had to refresh 3 times
[12/1/26, 12:09:47] ~ Alex Pylypenko: i refreshed once a second ish
[12/1/26, 12:09:48] ~ Keanu: also idk how many tickets they sold i just yapped a guess because they have 2 waves and last year they had 700ppl total
[12/1/26, 12:10:05] ~ Keanu: I dont even live near london, im in mf sheffield and i somehow got one 😂
[12/1/26, 12:10:08] ~ Alex Pylypenko: not a single person I know (out of like 10ish who tried) managed to get a ticket
[12/1/26, 12:10:11] ~ Alex Pylypenko: so congratulations
[12/1/26, 12:10:22] ~ Alex Pylypenko: I was convinced that most people who got tickets probably botted
[12/1/26, 12:11:07] ~ Keanu: yeah probably 😭 but i couldnt bring myself to do that especially since last year i got one without botting also
[12/1/26, 12:11:15] ~ Keanu: although last year on 2nd wave tickets only sold out in 60 seconds not 20..
[12/1/26, 12:11:52] Haziq KXHL: the lecture will exist without you. will you exist with the lecture. that is the question
[12/1/26, 12:11:57] ~ Keanu: yes
[12/1/26, 12:12:12] ~ Keanu: plug yourself into ethernet also for the extra latency 🙏
[12/1/26, 12:13:07] Hera KXHL: is there anywhere on campus i can plug into
[12/1/26, 12:13:11] ~ Alex Pylypenko: I am convinced that (this year, at least) you're at least one order of magnitude out
[12/1/26, 12:13:33] ~ Alex Pylypenko: in that I think they sold out in <5s
[12/1/26, 12:13:45] Haziq KXHL: bro is always on some neo-from the-matrix behavior istg this is keanu reeves fr fr

[13/1/26, 13:03:15] Yi Hein: need to build GPT-2 asap
[13/1/26, 13:06:07] ~ Ada Ge: is claude coding a valid use of hacking time? 🥲
[13/1/26, 13:06:28] ~ Ada Ge: i need to try it out, i still haven't
[13/1/26, 13:36:23] Haziq KXHL: asking permission to vibe code is crazy 😭 yes its valid 
thats literlly the core function of hackclubs worldwide
[13/1/26, 13:36:53] Haziq KXHL: all the other stuff we do is just our own personal curses, pls do not apologise for normal hack club behaviour
[13/1/26, 13:39:18] ‎You: ‎You pinned a message
[13/1/26, 13:44:40] Yi Hein: The requirement of KXHL is to work on something you are passionate about, with an emphasis on *fun*, fun that excites you to explore more.

There are no other pre-requisites.
[13/1/26, 14:03:08] ~ Alex Pylypenko: You're missing out.....
[13/1/26, 15:19:55] Haziq KXHL: "corporate has introduced fun as a key performance indicator"
[13/1/26, 15:24:39] Haziq KXHL: okkk fine i’m acc gonna join you at 9. bro is genuinely the role model for us all. doing this on top of a startup job, clinical placements, USMLE etc etc and still having the audacity to lecture us about balance is crazy 😭
[13/1/26, 16:38:00] Haziq KXHL: oh god im about to say something and i hope this doesn’t devolve into storytime 4 🫣
[13/1/26, 16:38:48] Haziq KXHL: sooo the other reason im partial to converging lamarckian process theories is… darwin’s tree of life is literally burning. like istg molecular phylogenetics threw a molotov cocktail on it. this what people in the field call “evolution wars”
[13/1/26, 16:40:06] Haziq KXHL: the original darwinian idea was: there must exist one latent branching process underlying all speciation and it should show up in everything. fossils, morphology, behaviour, development, molecules all point to the same tree. except all these fields were already fighting each other like cats and dogs 😵‍💫
[13/1/26, 16:41:10] Haziq KXHL: paleontology especially is a moving target. like if i had a penny for the number of times they reordered the whale series... (still messed up btw no one is buying dog to whale in just 50 million years with a straight face)
[13/1/26, 16:42:08] Haziq KXHL: so that’s why dawkins and them were like ok chuck all this in the bin, we have molecular phylogenetics now. tbh it was totally awesome at first. but also lowkey a shady move because literally all your intuitions about the tree of life come from paleontology and morphology and now you want to discard it based on molecular bio 🤷‍♂️
[13/1/26, 16:43:08] Haziq KXHL: but then each freaking gene gives a different tree. cytochrome B was basically the molotov cocktail moment. instead of convergence everything explodes. our cope was vibe checking genes like “this one is too weird, evolution did something it should not have here, so that’s why this tree is wrong”. wrong relative to what? the paleontology you just told me to ignore??
[13/1/26, 16:44:03] Haziq KXHL: so now fossils are unreliable unless they agree with molecular trees, molecular trees are unreliable unless they agree with fossil intuitions, none of the trees agree with each other anyway, behaviour and development are just screaming into the void and the tree of life has quite literally become a social construct 😭
[13/1/26, 16:57:42] ~ manav: Don’t you think this is quite uncontroversial tho
[13/1/26, 16:58:59] ~ manav: Maybe I don’t understand exactly what the thrust of your point is but this is only really problematic for ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny and other stuff for which morphological trees are load bearing
[13/1/26, 16:59:30] ~ manav: The idea that certain morphologies are niche-adaptive attractor states that many genetic routes converge to is just a baseline thing in this day and age
[13/1/26, 16:59:53] ~ manav: Carcinization is everyone’s favourite example
[13/1/26, 17:00:40] ~ manav: I would say that the molecular trees are a decent ground truth no?
[13/1/26, 17:03:59] ~ manav: “But given the search space, how-“ yes yes we have established this now but how is the stacked contingencies problem uniquely problematic here
[13/1/26, 17:16:55] Haziq KXHL: yeah i don’t actually disagree with any of that. i’m leaning on convergence and hoping carcinization gives credence to my stance. the thing i’m pushing on is the sense in which convergence is happening
[13/1/26, 17:17:48] Haziq KXHL: in the standard darwinian framing, convergence is still multiple independent random-ish walks through an insane genetic search space that just happen to land in similar regions because the endpoints are good. but even one such walk is already cursed in terms of probability and now you’re asking for it to happen multiple times independently. compound probability kills you
[13/1/26, 17:18:20] Haziq KXHL: that’s why dawkins and co love the tree of life so much. a single branching history buys you time i.e. a feature can slowly accrete once, get stabilised and then diverge. you don’t have to repeatedly solve the same hard search problem from scratch
[13/1/26, 17:19:04] Haziq KXHL: what i’m interested in is lamarckian style convergence where systems are being actively guided through phenotype space so that similar problems reliably lead to similar solutions without paying the full random walk cost each time. carcinization looks like that on the surface
[13/1/26, 17:20:10] Haziq KXHL: yeah wed hope so but cytochrome B is also a molecular tree 😭 no single gene reliably coincides with another. if u ask “which molecular tree is ground truth” youre already making judgement calls
[13/1/26, 17:27:40] ~ manav: Neat but there still has to be a driver right
[13/1/26, 17:28:50] Haziq KXHL: 😭😭😭 thought you’d never ask, yes unfortunately, information problem creeps back in, ill explain Michael Levin’s cope in a bit
[13/1/26, 17:29:29] Haziq KXHL: basically he and friston think they can solve it with pan psychism not even joking 😵‍💫 ‎<This message was edited>
[13/1/26, 17:54:51] ~ manav: Certain formulations of panpsychism are digestible but you know my whole schtick with dissociating awareness from mind
[13/1/26, 18:22:08] Haziq KXHL: so basically you know how we were saying natural induction is search through phenotype space via bioelectric patterns with top down control of morphology and natural selection just comes in later to genetically fix whatever survives...
[13/1/26, 18:23:37] Haziq KXHL: but then the obvious problem is if natural induction is just some noisy dynamical system over bioelectric patterns then search is still cursed. lamarck’s giraffe doesn’t just have “grow neck” available... it has a zillion other moves in morphospace. elongate toenails, inflate spleen, double eyelashes, spiralize kneecaps, grow decorative cartilage horns, rearrange intestines into modern art 🦒👨‍🎨

that takes way too long. you’ve just reinvented the same intractable search problem except now it’s happening at the phenotype level instead of DNA (which is lowkey worse imo)
[13/1/26, 18:24:59] Haziq KXHL: so the only thing that seems to actually fix this is intent like genuine goal directed control of morphodynamics. something that says “the problem is reach higher” and therefore pushes changes along the neck axis instead of meandering across the entire morphospace
[13/1/26, 18:29:35] Haziq KXHL: this is where they resort to panpsychism. as soon as intent becomes load bearing for morphogenesis,, cognition can’t be a late evolutionary add on anymore ‎<This message was edited>
[13/1/26, 18:36:40] Haziq KXHL: tbh i don’t really have a dog in this fight. i’m open to literally anything that actually solves OOL, even freaking loop quantum gravity which i mentally put on the same high shelf as panpsychism. if it works it works.

the thing is i’m still not convinced that slapping a goal on the system actually constrains morphospace that hard. even with an objective like “reach higher” the giraffe still has an absurd number of idiotic degrees of freedom it could push on instead

and if universal cognition is resting on friston’s FEP then god have mercy on us all ☠️
[13/1/26, 18:38:09] ~ manav: The problem with panpsychism and similar formulations where metaphysics actually intrudes onto the material domain in a way that isn’t just a foundation is that it’s so hungry ‎<This message was edited>
[13/1/26, 18:38:33] ~ manav: It doesn’t just consume the problem you’ve scoped it to deal with but also inserts itself into any other difficult empirical problem
[13/1/26, 18:39:57] ~ manav: As you basically imply over here, to make natural induction work you have to overload intention so hard that there are no biological problems left
[13/1/26, 18:42:09] Haziq KXHL: 💯💯😭
yessss tell me about it
friston’s FEP basically says “cognition” means “exists for more than five minutes”
rocks are bayesian agents, thermostats are philosophers etc
[13/1/26, 18:49:15] ~ manav: Imo metaphysics is necessary precisely to avoid this kind of magical thinking
[13/1/26, 18:55:13] ~ manav: Will there ever be an OOL session on FEP
[13/1/26, 18:58:40] ~ Euan Ong: ~can we have a session on FP instead~ ‎<This message was edited>
[13/1/26, 19:05:51] ~ manav: ‎This message was deleted.
[13/1/26, 19:11:58] ~ manav: So here is my issue. To account for layers of separation we need some sort of nested markov blanket right? E.g. deep temporal models. We have this hierarchy of blankets - the sensory layer predicts raw data, the perceptual layer predicts the sensory layer (e.g. recognising faces), the conceptual/mentation layer predicts the perceptual layer and so on. turtles all the way down
[13/1/26, 19:12:41] ~ Dylan: ~return of the PL reading group~
[13/1/26, 19:16:00] ~ manav: But now we have a regress issue, and regresses are intolerable to FEP because we are adding complexity asymptotically without the surprisal reduction to pay it off. So now we have the hyperprior as the unmoved mover
[13/1/26, 19:18:13] ~ manav: And the regress stops because the thermodynamic cost of computing the regress is not worth the surprisal reduction
[13/1/26, 19:18:57] ~ manav: This is just a strange loop right? And susceptible to my criticism of strange loops a few days ago
[13/1/26, 19:26:17] ~ manav: you just have to take the backdrop of awareness upon which predictive processing occurs as ‘given’ because the thermodynamic laws that characterise free energy minimisation rely on that backdrop being ‘given’ too
[13/1/26, 19:27:35] Haziq KXHL: i like to keep my left field scientific interests and my psychedelics in separate folders, thank you 😭
[13/1/26, 19:27:56] ~ manav: ‘given awareness, thermodynamic laws force the minimisation of free energy’ ok great but now you’ve already introduced a transcendental epistemological postulate what even is the point of all of this FEP? Occam’s guillotine
[13/1/26, 19:28:24] ~ manav: we can stick to normal empirics
[13/1/26, 19:31:01] Haziq KXHL: 😭 never thought ppl would wanna talk about rocks’ feelings instead of the grandest question of them all, OOL, obviously, ofc, duh…
[13/1/26, 19:31:53] Haziq KXHL: @⁨Ariel KXHL⁩ the ppl have spoken. would you be down to do a seminar? bc I feel like anyone else would just strawman FEP for sport and call it a day
[13/1/26, 19:35:55] Haziq KXHL: love how we’re using strikethrough to signal epistemic humility
~or emotional damage~
[13/1/26, 19:37:02] Ariel KXHL: I would be down to run something in like september, maybe?? 😭 am going to be quite crazily busy for the next few months
[13/1/26, 19:37:24] Ariel KXHL: also sorry I have not been reading this chat bc y’all talk *a lot*
[13/1/26, 19:37:43] Yi Hein: we can do a FP session too (cc: @⁨Alex KXHL⁩ ?)
[13/1/26, 19:38:13] Ariel KXHL: I would definitely be down to run smth after explainer part 2 is done

@⁨Alex KXHL⁩ what do you say? let us know once you’ve recovered from the Taylor situation which @⁨Hera KXHL⁩ has thoughtfully captured in screenplay form
[13/1/26, 19:53:02] Haziq KXHL: KXHL wishes you well in your ongoing quest to minimise surprise 🫡
may september arrive with low entropy and favourable posteriors
[13/1/26, 19:54:04] Haziq KXHL: guilty as charged, your honour

[13/1/26, 19:55:13] Ariel KXHL: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.07577
[13/1/26, 19:56:20] Haziq KXHL: hopefully part 2 explains why you deployed an ansatz midstream instead of deriving the general solution from the axioms 👀
[13/1/26, 19:57:16] Haziq KXHL: category theoretic FEP is not real and cannot hurt me 😭
[13/1/26, 19:57:45] Alex KXHL: That means functional programming
[13/1/26, 19:57:48] Alex KXHL: ?
[13/1/26, 19:58:51] Alex KXHL: Sure, I love functional programming
[13/1/26, 19:59:48] Alex KXHL: with all the acronyms being thrown around here, i wasn't sure😅
[13/1/26, 20:00:21] Haziq KXHL: 🙄 classic alex, gaslighting us again. taylor was not wrong...
[13/1/26, 20:01:05] Alex KXHL: lmao
[13/1/26, 20:01:30] Alex KXHL: all my category theory knowledge is purely practical (for use in haskell)
[13/1/26, 20:01:34] Alex KXHL: but i'd be happy to share what i know
[13/1/26, 20:02:52] Haziq KXHL: perfect!! all our category theory knowledge is purely theoretical (as in it doesn’t exist) so happy to learn!!
[13/1/26, 20:04:07] Haziq KXHL: fyi if we say NMB-FEP-OOL-CT-FP we expect u to know it means “nested markov blankets free energy origin of life category theory functional programming”
[13/1/26, 20:16:42] Haziq KXHL: bro this is acc a sick burn. this is exactly why i dragged you into the FEP debate sensei 😆. ppl really out here ignoring decades of metaphysics just to trip over the same issues again except now it’s a cult

also hilarious to me how “free energy” starts as a modest variational approximation to probability and then suddenly obeys thermodynamic laws 😮‍💨
[13/1/26, 20:22:53] Haziq KXHL: @⁨~Alp Duygu⁩ ☝️ flagging this for dr duygu: levin on conway-kochen / the free will theorem (lowkey non-determinism...??)
*tl;dr* math, supposedly, says if we have free will then particles do too. 
conway really heard “we shouldn’t trust atoms bc they make up everything” and said hold my hagoromo chalk
[13/1/26, 20:26:05] Haziq KXHL: @⁨~Suhas⁩ @⁨~Ada Ge⁩ 
ok my fellow EA brethren/sistren
 if particles have feelings now... how’s the Higgs boson welfare fund coming along?
asking as a strong moral circle expansion enjoyer
happy to donate btw 🤥
[13/1/26, 20:52:52] Niv Ucl Builder: FUCK YEAH!!!!
[13/1/26, 21:43:31] ~ manav: I actually think the thermodynamic thing is ok. FEP is clever about this - as Friston always says it’s a principle so cannot be brought down by anything empirical
[13/1/26, 21:44:57] ~ manav: If I understand correctly, if you take FEP in its strongest sense, it yields a markovian monism or ontic structural realism which basically j entails that the laws of thermodynamics _only exist insofar as_ they minimise surprise
[13/1/26, 21:45:11] ~ Suhas: new years resolution is to ignore ea bait and just donate to AMF every time instead ‎<This message was edited>
[13/1/26, 21:51:01] ~ manav: I.e. it is kind of ontologising the correspondence theory of truth

every day like billions of higgs bosons are out there just grinding,, holding reality together for FREE btw,, giving mass to your coffee cup your laptop your emotional damage,, and no one ever checks in. no email. no survey. nothing. they didnt ask to pop into existence at 125 gev they didnt ask to decay immediately they were just like hi <3 and physics was like congrats youre responsible for mass now also youre invisible and everyone forgets you exist

for less than the cost of a latte (or idk a snack depending on the economy??),, you too can help raise awareness for an unseen unheard and frankly exploited population. call now and well send you a photo of a higgs boson that looks sad (artists impression may be a circle). please im begging. be the voice they dont have. bc if we dont speak for the higgs boson,, then who will.

[14/1/26, 00:16:59] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: What happened to Bambi? (I haven’t watched it lol)
[14/1/26, 00:22:05] Haziq KXHL: we don’t talk about bambi… watched it 15 years ago when i was 5 and it still hurts 😖
[14/1/26, 00:23:34] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: I just googles and Bambi is a he?!!! Wow
[14/1/26, 00:23:39] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Googled*
[14/1/26, 00:24:40] Haziq KXHL: when my nieces say “let’s watch the cute deer movie” i gaslight them bc i am not restarting my bambi grief cycle. i’m on stage 5 and staying there thank you 😵‍💫
[14/1/26, 00:25:29] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: I only watch movies after ~2015 😂
[14/1/26, 00:26:10] Haziq KXHL: bro has a knowledge cutoff like LLM
[14/1/26, 00:26:24] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Hahahaa
[14/1/26, 00:26:30] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Graphics in old movies annoy me
[14/1/26, 00:26:44] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: But some exceptions exist like top gun obv
[14/1/26, 00:27:25] Haziq KXHL: top gun 2 slapped ngl
"I Ain't Worried" by OneRepublic 🔥🔥
[14/1/26, 00:27:46] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Yess!!! 😋
[14/1/26, 00:29:06] Haziq KXHL: unfortunately i took “ain’t worried” as life advice
[14/1/26, 00:30:43] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: ‘Don’t think. Just do!’
[14/1/26, 00:31:01] ~ Elma : bars
[14/1/26, 00:40:01] Haziq KXHL: this feels like the start of a knock knock joke
[14/1/26, 00:40:12] Haziq KXHL: ok i’ll bite… who’s there
[14/1/26, 11:29:15] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Bars, Mars Bars
‎[14/1/26, 15:08:12] Haziq KXHL: @⁨~Elma ⁩ @⁨~Tuhan Sapumanage⁩ 
the math is not mathing but the string is stringing ‎image omitted
[14/1/26, 15:12:38] ~ Elma : what prompt did u use for this 🤣
[14/1/26, 15:12:57] ~ Elma : Lowkey I cba to update the copy I’ll get someone else to fix it
[14/1/26, 15:18:09] Haziq KXHL: as u should. classic consultant to founder pipeline behaviour tbh
[14/1/26, 15:18:33] Haziq KXHL: hack club ppl would’ve rewritten the copy, built the datacentre using only a soldering iron, powered it with potatoes and then forgotten to say hi to the investor
[14/1/26, 15:19:56] Haziq KXHL: it’s just ‘synergy’ repeated 40 times
[14/1/26, 15:22:47] Haziq KXHL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1631069119300976
"The Devonian hexapodan record is very scarce and disappointing, with less than six described fossils, all wingless [1]. The early Carboniferous one is even worse, without any fossil insects. But at the very end of this period and during the late Carboniferous, the insect diversity exploded, with a ‘sudden appearance’ of winged insects with very diverse feeding resources, e.g., carnivorous, plant suckers, leaf eaters, detritivorous, gall-makers, etc."
forgive the secondary reference but did y'all think Cambrian explosion was a one-off??
[14/1/26, 15:23:19] Haziq KXHL: me and my dawg darwin: surely this time we get gradual transitions
the paleozoic: lol no insects just spawn in fully diversified
[14/1/26, 15:26:17] Haziq KXHL: collector’s curve is supposed to go 📈 when we keep finding new fossils.
ours is going 😐🫥 flat as hell
meaning we’re digging more, trying harder and still finding basically nothing new.
which is bad bc it means the missing stuff isn’t “we haven’t looked yet”
it’s more like “bro there might just… not be intermediates there”
hence: everyone currently sweating
[14/1/26, 15:31:36] Haziq KXHL: idk whether to laugh or cry at “thermodynamics is subordinate to FEP” 😵‍💫
 i didnt mean thermo contradicts FEP,. i meant it simply doesnt apply to variational free energy because thats a mathematical construct not a physical quantity.
this only works if you blur the line between variational free energy and physical free energy on purpose which friston kinda does so FEP can escape math jail

maybe that’s just my hands on wet lab field work experimentalist bias speaking idk ‎<This message was edited>
[14/1/26, 20:14:59] ~ manav: I was gonna say dude
[14/1/26, 20:15:06] ~ manav: This is quackery
[14/1/26, 20:16:04] Haziq KXHL: I totally agree with you but also only engaging with it cos it’s coming from ppl like Noble and Friston and Levin who’ve done really impressive empirical work in another life ‎<This message was edited>
[14/1/26, 20:17:35] Haziq KXHL: also we gotta appreciate how they use maths as an intellectual facade for all their quackery lol
[14/1/26, 20:20:07] ~ Keanu: metaphysics? get outta here
[14/1/26, 20:21:04] Haziq KXHL: But like also pls do watch what he has to say cos he’s a UCL legend who discovered a lot of what we know about cardiac physiology
[14/1/26, 20:21:25] ~ Keanu: damn, aight, will pay my respects 🫡
[14/1/26, 20:23:49] Haziq KXHL: also we have a decent representation of ppl who adopt this at KXHL 👀 not to name any names so that’s why im curious. by our very own:

[14/1/26, 22:50:44] ~ Elma : I’m so annoying I just checked Barry’s too and they’re all booked
[14/1/26, 22:50:50] Haziq KXHL: btw if not london then where is apprentice living HQ??
[14/1/26, 22:50:53] ~ Elma : Talk abt last min adhd 😬
[14/1/26, 22:51:19] ~ Elma : my cave 😍
[14/1/26, 22:51:22] Haziq KXHL: how the hell does Barry’s have space to fit a freaking swimming pool in their lil basements??
[14/1/26, 22:51:27] ~ Elma : In essex
[14/1/26, 22:51:33] ~ Elma : 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
[14/1/26, 22:51:43] ~ Elma : Yk what their revenue model is 10/10
[14/1/26, 22:51:52] ~ Elma : Just pay rent on one basement done
[14/1/26, 22:52:02] Haziq KXHL: but honestly i wouldnt know abt barry's cos i refuse to pay more than 20£ for gym membership
[14/1/26, 22:52:21] ~ Elma : They don’t have a pool I meant I just wanted to get a workout in before I started my day
[14/1/26, 22:52:28] ~ Elma : But they’re so popular
[14/1/26, 22:52:36] ~ Elma : Everywheres booked
[14/1/26, 22:52:40] Haziq KXHL: oh wow very CEO behaviour
[14/1/26, 22:52:41] ~ Elma : Fairss
[14/1/26, 22:52:57] Haziq KXHL: literally every lifestyle video
[14/1/26, 22:53:04] ~ Elma : Yk what the GP’s at YC say 😩😩😩😩😩😩😩
[14/1/26, 22:53:14] ~ Elma : Just speak to ur customers and work out
[14/1/26, 22:53:21] ~ Elma : And build
[14/1/26, 22:53:21] Haziq KXHL: fake it till you make it?
[14/1/26, 22:53:36] ~ Elma : close enough
[14/1/26, 22:53:50] ~ Elma : They put a lot of emphasis on working out it’s interesting
[14/1/26, 22:56:52] Haziq KXHL: YC really said: the product may not work out but the founders will
[14/1/26, 23:00:55] Haziq KXHL: also btw day pass in this economy is crazy 🫠
[14/1/26, 23:06:33] ~ Elma : Lool but the advice together is excellent bc it forces u to ship features customers actually want.

I think most tech founders fail bc they don’t speak to users enough or pressure test enough, don’t think abt distribution enough so adoption rate metrics are low or tell a story that isnt actually true bc they didn’t speak to enough customers. YC lowkey teaching u how to have better ppl skills too which is essential in business
[14/1/26, 23:07:44] ~ Elma : It’s 15 right? And yh everything is quite pricey but the vanity area makes it worth imo 😔
[14/1/26, 23:08:17] ~ Elma : Not sure if it’s worth it for guys but the women’s one is proper decked out w freebies and the best hair tools
[14/1/26, 23:09:08] Haziq KXHL: no you’re right… meanwhile i’m an aspiring athlete w over a decade of training and somehow still zero people skills. false advertising

[14/1/26, 23:39:00] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Paper vertically divided to 3

[14/1/26, 23:39:10] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Waterfall

[14/1/26, 23:43:18] Haziq KXHL: casual child prodigy behaviour
[14/1/26, 23:43:34] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Bad art or other one
[14/1/26, 23:43:46] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: But no man most child prodigies I know are sad miserable
[14/1/26, 23:44:16] ~ Elma : Guys pick a or b
[14/1/26, 23:44:32] Haziq KXHL: the fact that your life is so time dilated you didnt even clock it
[14/1/26, 23:44:45] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: From?
[14/1/26, 23:44:53] ~ Elma : I’ll tell u after
[14/1/26, 23:45:10] Haziq KXHL: lucky me, not child prodigy yet sad and miserable
[14/1/26, 23:45:24] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Right like it felt like a lifetime between that drawing and uni 😂 that’s crazy!!!
[14/1/26, 23:45:32] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: YOU ARE A CHILD PRODIGY
[14/1/26, 23:45:33] ~ Elma : First one to say a letter dictates my fate for tomorrow

[14/1/26, 23:50:16] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Okay jokes aside what’s this?

[14/1/26, 23:53:17] Haziq KXHL: i still remember the doctor asking me what took so long to come out and i was like traffic in the womb was crazy doc

[15/1/26, 09:31:53] Yi Hein: does it not have merit or you just don’t like the field is brain rot in general?
[15/1/26, 09:33:58] Niv Ucl Builder: this looks quite interesting to me!!! the abstract sounds promising but ill have to read the rest of the paper
[15/1/26, 09:36:21] Haziq KXHL: i just can’t pretend to care about another llm paper that doesn’t move theory or explain anything about intelligence, like congrats on the benchmark ig

if this is progress then the bar is underground
[15/1/26, 09:40:53] Niv Ucl Builder: i think theres a time for both of these.
[15/1/26, 09:42:29] Niv Ucl Builder: i think it is cool to see what authors try to do to make these "benchmarks" better
[15/1/26, 09:42:57] Niv Ucl Builder: i think its also a fun task to dissect if whether what they have done has practical use in the way models are served or if its just a bigger number for the sake of a bigger number ‎<This message was edited>
[15/1/26, 09:44:23] Haziq KXHL: yeah for sure, someone’s gotta keep optimising the llm gf pipeline while the rest of us work on actual questions
[15/1/26, 09:45:57] Niv Ucl Builder: i would rather the llm gf pipeline be a bit more efficient so that we can focus compute on other things too!
[15/1/26, 09:46:43] Niv Ucl Builder: particularly i think these papers make for a really fun journal club
[15/1/26, 09:47:17] Haziq KXHL: sorry i’m just a very disgruntled biologist in an underfunded field who finds it hard to get excited about how overcompensated ml is relative to the conceptual output
[15/1/26, 09:47:51] Haziq KXHL: yeah but somehow “make llm gfs 5% more efficient” always becomes the other thing we focus compute on
[15/1/26, 09:48:37] Niv Ucl Builder: but surely you then know about how important transformers are to biology
[15/1/26, 09:48:47] Niv Ucl Builder: and how little efficiencies like this help labs out quite a bit
[15/1/26, 09:48:53] Niv Ucl Builder: especially with HPC stuff
[15/1/26, 09:49:02] Niv Ucl Builder: and in an underfunded field that helps you get more done
[15/1/26, 09:49:49] Haziq KXHL: yeah 100% transformers have been huge for biology. i just wish biology got the same level of funding hype as chat models do
[15/1/26, 09:50:58] Haziq KXHL: i promise you no one in my field is compute limited. we’re grant limited, reagent limited, time limited and sanity limited long before hpc enters the picture
[15/1/26, 09:53:05] Niv Ucl Builder: really? this is not what my view of the field is. i do understand that you may be time limited but that is why computation exists, to cut down tedious manual work
[15/1/26, 09:53:30] Niv Ucl Builder: from the brief glance i have had at the paper, i do not see them just focusing on chat models
[15/1/26, 09:53:42] Niv Ucl Builder: it seems like just general work that tries to go beyond the transformer
[15/1/26, 09:53:47] Niv Ucl Builder: and i think thats really cool research!
[15/1/26, 09:55:32] Yi Hein: FYI: the hardcore lock-in session has moved to UCL Student Centre. It’s open to public in the day. DM me if you need help finding us

The session at 5.30pm is still at *Kings Cross*
[15/1/26, 09:55:54] Haziq KXHL: welcome to women’s health research where “just use computation” assumes we even have money for basic lab supplies

yes in theory computation replaces manual work. in practice all the money gets sucked into the llm vacuum before it ever reaches fields still fighting for baseline infrastructure
[15/1/26, 10:00:48] ~ manav: Can I just come and work on normal lecture stuff lol
[15/1/26, 10:00:55] Yi Hein: Yeah ofc
[15/1/26, 10:01:47] Yi Hein: this is the fundamental difference between an engineer and a scientist
[15/1/26, 10:02:58] Yi Hein: Lots of ML papers like these are meant to solve problems with machines used by people. Despite the how severely lacking our understanding of how these machines work
[15/1/26, 10:07:21] Haziq KXHL: engineering the same chatbot 500 times is not the hill i’d choose to pour unlimited money into but go off i guess
[15/1/26, 10:07:50] Haziq KXHL: sorry but “we’re just making things useful for people” feels like cope when the thing is better chat behavior
[15/1/26, 10:10:16] Haziq KXHL: also this is me reacting to the tech industry straight up shaping national funding agendas lol. watching places like the turing institute drift from biomedical applied maths into weapons ai / palantir adjacent nonsense is acc insane. like that is literally my tax money
[15/1/26, 10:14:56] ~ Alex Pylypenko: > engineering the same chatbot 500 times
..... -_-
[15/1/26, 10:15:32] ~ Alex Pylypenko: I can _partly_ see where you're coming from but ..... the chatbots are most definitely not the same
[15/1/26, 10:15:47] Yi Hein: would you have said the same about the the internet era?
[15/1/26, 10:16:21] Yi Hein: every single part of the web/internet pipeline has been extensively optimised
[15/1/26, 10:16:41] Yi Hein: we would not have whatsapp without those engineering breathroughs
[15/1/26, 10:17:50] Yi Hein: also that “chat” just wrote a new browser in rust (although it has quite a few dependencies), 3 millions lines of code

https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender
[15/1/26, 10:18:36] ~ Alex Pylypenko: actually I think we should collectively move back to the IRC
[15/1/26, 10:19:11] Yi Hein: poor capital allocation in women’s health is real, but that is also the fundemental part of where your opportunity lies to change that
[15/1/26, 10:22:59] Yi Hein: also btw guys, for any repos you have worked on in KXHL, send me the github link and i can add it as a submodule in the KXHL repo to feature it

https://github.com/yiheinchai/kingscrosshacklab/tree/main/projects
[15/1/26, 10:23:12] Niv Ucl Builder: but thats just not what anyone here is arguing 😭
[15/1/26, 10:24:29] Haziq KXHL: ik ik im just tryna be annoying. biologist sanctimony is one helluva drug 😆
[15/1/26, 10:29:13] Haziq KXHL: they’re not the same but both owe me money
[15/1/26, 10:31:07] Haziq KXHL: bold of you to assume whatsapp was worth all this
[15/1/26, 10:32:48] ~ Euan Ong: any better? https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/linebreaks/index.html
[15/1/26, 10:34:07] Haziq KXHL: i just love how public funding works now. we funnel money into whatever industry is loudest then later we’re like “see? some of it helped!” as if that was the plan and not a happy accident
[15/1/26, 10:36:03] Haziq KXHL: yeah love the framing where systemic underfunding is actually a ✨character building opportunity✨
like thank you for reframing neglect as a startup pitch
[15/1/26, 10:37:20] ~ Alex Pylypenko: wait this is actually so cool
[15/1/26, 10:38:48] Haziq KXHL: this is the good stuff. it’ll actually feed into neural population coding / neural manifold ideas
[15/1/26, 10:39:17] Haziq KXHL: see: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02031-z
[15/1/26, 10:43:26] ~ Arinze: I think when we had our first chat many weeks ago people were like they just want to do this for fun. I think that’s the sentiment is right - explore but there’s real money to be made in AI stuff/start ups
[15/1/26, 10:43:34] ~ Arinze: So many companies chucking money around
[15/1/26, 11:18:46] Haziq KXHL: 🎶 oh what fun it is to toil
in a field no one will fund
while others chase startup money
and call our suffering “for fun” 🎶
[15/1/26, 11:36:05] Haziq KXHL: id be lying if i said i wasnt a masochist like i genuinely thrive on life instability and risky career / financial situations. ive literally chased tigers on foot and fallen into a 300m ravine and barely got out so choosing a cursed field checks out

but im also projecting a lot of second hand rage from colleagues mostly women who are way less annoying than me who are in this field because if they dont do womens health literally no one will because no one else seems to give a ... and theyd also like to afford rent one day if thats not too much to ask
[15/1/26, 11:36:54] Haziq KXHL: so yeah if im loud its because theyre polite and burned out and someone has to say this isnt a quirky passion project its necessary work that keeps getting starved while money gets vacuumed into llm gfs and startup cosplay
[15/1/26, 11:57:22] ~ Arinze: Do you not think you need to play the system rather than attempting to be “more righteous than thou” (no offence intended) in order to get what you want
[15/1/26, 11:58:17] ~ Arinze: Money is almost everything in fields such as medicine especially when you want to solve inequalities and injustices. You either raise it or earn it. ‎<This message was edited>
[15/1/26, 12:00:09] ~ Arinze: I have found that those in control of massive organisations only care if you’re making them money (even if it is a noble cause)
[15/1/26, 12:07:59] ~ Arinze: And just 1 more thing so I’m not personally opposed. I understand the sentiment, yes it makes sense, but unfortunately that’s just not the world we live in. I may sound pessimistic (I’m not, I just accept the world for what it is), but idealistic mindsets get trampled on in a world of savage profit driven leaders
[15/1/26, 12:09:24] Yi Hein: I think that is the point, capitalistic resource allocation is inefficient, that how we got to the state we are in. Playing the game won’t change that but reinforce those biases
[15/1/26, 12:09:33] Haziq KXHL: @⁨Yi Hein⁩ congrats on starting the only gc where altruism gets pushback like it’s a character flaw
[15/1/26, 12:09:45] Haziq KXHL: im not trying to save the world btw i just think it’s extremely funny and correct to stand next to the people who are and give any objectors absolute hell about it
[15/1/26, 12:10:19] Haziq KXHL: also love the “just play the system” advice as if public research has some hidden quick money button we’re refusing to press. yeah let me go tell my colleagues hey folks lets shut down women’s health for a bit pivot to ai girlfriends, raise a seed round, IPO and then we’ll circle back to inequality once we’ve made enough money for it to matter
[15/1/26, 12:11:23] Haziq KXHL: bars. piketty approved
[15/1/26, 12:13:03] ~ Arinze: Show me a proven alternative
[15/1/26, 12:13:06] Yi Hein: No one is doing personal / character attacks on you, let’s not make this a thing in KXHL, it is possible to have an insightful discussion even with opposing viewpoints.
[15/1/26, 12:13:54] ~ Arinze: Yes in a movie that works, irl ppl are waiting to step on you 😭
[15/1/26, 12:14:15] Haziq KXHL: ik ik lol i’m not taking it personally at all, just being annoying as usual
[15/1/26, 12:14:31] ~ Euan Ong: side other thought — the vision of ai done well doesn’t have to look like ai girlfriends

see also: https://www.darioamodei.com/essay/machines-of-loving-grace
[15/1/26, 12:14:40] ~ Arinze: I think the only thing that crushes capitalism is violence, and I’m not inciting that. I don’t believe in violence but the only alternative is to play the system.
[15/1/26, 12:14:49] ~ Arinze: Unless you are pro btc / cryptocurrency
[15/1/26, 12:15:27] ~ Arinze: Thank you
[15/1/26, 12:15:51] Haziq KXHL: thats why i’m unironically a prick for self defense reasons
[15/1/26, 12:16:07] Yi Hein: I think it’s quite hard to find a successful founder that starts a company with the goal of “let’s get rich”
[15/1/26, 12:16:57] Yi Hein: The pain of starting a company typically outweighs the miniscule chance of financial success ‎<This message was edited>
[15/1/26, 12:18:58] ~ Arinze: It’s not let’s get rich, sorry if it came across wrong. It’s “let’s find a problem, build for the future (ie use the emerging tech), and have a good financial model”
[15/1/26, 12:18:58] Haziq KXHL: “show me a proven alternative” like we didnt already run one lol postwar europe, japan and the us 45 to 80 had high taxes, massive public investment, strong unions and growth was insane, inequality dropped and science actually got funded. piketty literally documents this in Capital and Ideology

the internet gps semiconductors biotech pharma all came from state funded research not market magic. markets just showed up later to privatise the wins

so yeah the alternative isnt imaginary we just dismantled it and now pretend this version of capitalism is natural law
[15/1/26, 12:19:42] ~ Arinze: After turmoil it’s easy to be positive and promote benefit for all
[15/1/26, 12:19:45] ~ Arinze: Come on
[15/1/26, 12:20:03] ~ Arinze: Weak argument
[15/1/26, 12:20:47] Haziq KXHL: dismissing history as a mood swing is not the dunk you think it is
[15/1/26, 12:21:38] ~ Arinze: It’s obvious to anyone that studies history that once the world is reduced to mourning and ashes, people aren’t going to want anything that causes more sorrow, and rather switch to aim for positive outcomes.
[15/1/26, 12:22:54] ~ Arinze: Ying Yang , balances of life. This is the longest time we’ve been without a major war (usually there’s one every 80-100 years). Ie we’re slightly behind schedule
[15/1/26, 12:25:55] Yi Hein: just my two cents. capitalism works because it is an automatic optimisation ability. it doesn’t work because the thing it is optimising for may not correlate with human welfare. other ideologies combat this with handcrafted systems to try to align to human welfare as much as possible. however, there is only so much human hours that can be spent doing handcrafted policy making, and you end up with an inefficient system. Alternative, the human designing the policies are also optimising for the wrong thing.
[15/1/26, 12:27:39] ~ Arinze: I agree with this, I’m not opposed to any of this. I’ve been arguing for this kind of thing since secondary school. It just gets to a point where you see what the world is truly like and unless the movement is so big, those few who hang their necks out are sacrificial lamb
[15/1/26, 12:27:48] Haziq KXHL: _(🎹 sad piano but like someone is clearly missing keys and keeps going anyway)_

every day,,, somewhere,,, a founder wakes up and chooses suffering (not like famine or illness or systemic neglect but like inbox suffering) they open slack they open notion they open a calendar thats just rectangles yelling at them. they didnt ask for this. they didnt ask to have a deck or a vision or to explain their startup to a guy named brad who says "love it but whats the moat". they didnt ask to refresh email 300 times waiting for a vc reply that just says circling back and yet here they are grinding traumatised resilient brave (very brave) meanwhile people have real problems like being sick broke underfunded or doing womens health research with zero money but ok lets centre founder pain

for less than the cost of a latte (or idk two depending on inflation) you too can help raise awareness for this unseen unheard and extremely validated population your donation helps fund cold brew hoodies and long linkedin posts about resilience (and a sense of purpose) call now and we will send you a photo of a founder staring out a window thinking about product market fit (artists impression may include macbook glow) please check in on your local founder they are going through a lot

_(soft piano suddenly louder screen shakes slightly someone sniffles off mic for no reason)_
[15/1/26, 12:29:22] Haziq KXHL: love how everything except the actual history part is “obvious to anyone who studies history”
[15/1/26, 12:30:38] ~ Arinze: You’re funny I’ll give you that ahah. Like I think youre just failing to realise that you have to outsmart a system to triumph, head on combat against powers that already sacrifice lives (trade off/welfare loss) is stupid as they’re already willing to sacrifice more lives than you are to get what they desire
[15/1/26, 12:31:18] ~ Arinze: I just assumed I was speaking to someone well versed in the history of modern Europe. You would have to be intellectually challenged to not understand what I described. ‎<This message was edited>
[15/1/26, 12:34:28] ~ Arinze: “From the bottom, the only way is up”
[15/1/26, 12:44:13] Yi Hein: Final warning no personal attacks on this group
[15/1/26, 12:45:18] ~ manav: How are the social contingencies that generated public mandate for social democracy not part of “actual history”
[15/1/26, 12:48:49] ~ manav: Everyone wants West Berlin three arrows utopia again but what I understand @⁨~Arinze⁩ to be arguing is that signalling that you want West Berlin three arrows utopia is inferior to instantiating the parallel systems you need for the outcomes you want given the constraints of poor mandate and regulatory capture, unless you are willing to do a useless violent revolution
[15/1/26, 12:50:44] ~ manav: FWIW if you take a position from nowhere and say you are just Mersault laughing at the degeneracy of our rentier economy or something I will never discuss a political issue with you again, simply because the point of discussing is to do something
[15/1/26, 12:55:18] ~ manav: Do I think the aesthetics and motivations of VC and techbro approaches to social problems are disgusting? Yes absolutely. Is a large proportion of it disingenuous, and an even larger proportion ineffectual? Yes. But as I’ve said before, one does not first apprehend a pure field of value and then decide whether to move. One finds oneself already moving, already implicated, already answerable and only then articulates what matters
[15/1/26, 12:57:12] ~ Ada Ge: thanks manav for stepping in and putting reasonable moderate syntheses out there before haziq and interlocuter spiral completely for the 2nd time
[15/1/26, 12:59:58] Haziq KXHL: “behind schedule” is such a funny way to talk about millions of people dying...
[15/1/26, 13:01:20] ~ manav: Oh fuuuuck dude he said it which is basically the same as (i) endorsing it (ii) taking violent glee in the prospect (iii) pushing the WW3 button
[15/1/26, 13:01:24] ~ manav: Be so fr dude
[15/1/26, 13:01:32] ~ manav: Let’s go object level
[15/1/26, 13:01:44] ~ manav: How do we escape cycles of violence
[15/1/26, 13:03:09] ~ Ada Ge: hegemony where the interests of the hegemon and the subjects are aligned
[15/1/26, 13:04:18] ~ Ada Ge: pax romana, pax americana etc.
[15/1/26, 13:04:36] ~ manav: Ofc counterfactuals are not really possible but any time (I can think of) that this has been tried the amount of resultant violence is far greater than whatever local conflicts would have occurred sans hegemon
[15/1/26, 13:05:05] ~ manav: In other words no one ever tries to instantiate empire without believing that they are the aligned noble divine hegemony
[15/1/26, 13:05:43] ~ manav: In fact it’s kinda ironic, I think cycles of violence are largely driven by one powerful actor thinking exactly this ‎<This message was edited>
[15/1/26, 13:05:52] ~ Ada Ge: hmm 🤔
[15/1/26, 13:06:24] ~ manav: The civilising mission etc
[15/1/26, 13:07:28] ~ Ada Ge: ok is there a stable equilibrium where everyone follows the non aggression principle or something? or where powers are balanced, or where somehow more powerful organizations don't want to eat less powerful ones
[15/1/26, 13:09:35] ~ manav: Idk but I’m not confident in my ability to solve these totalising problems lol. But I do believe that articulating one positive vision is worth a thousand critiques that lack counterfactuals
[15/1/26, 13:09:52] ~ manav: And if everyone here is so smart then that should be the focus
[15/1/26, 13:10:08] ~ Ada Ge: i think European style human rights are good for welfare but Europeans still had to be able enough for their word to matter ‎<This message was edited>
[15/1/26, 13:11:21] ~ manav: I guess my belief is that European social democracy in the 20th century was actually very good and simply stabilising that paradigm would be a big achievement
[15/1/26, 13:11:51] ~ manav: But the fact that it wasn’t stable is a failure of the system too
[15/1/26, 13:12:26] ~ Ada Ge: yeagh
[15/1/26, 13:16:00] ~ manav: There are good lefty diagnoses of this problem. One is that the third world subsidised it, others to do with regulatory capture, weakening social ties, concentration of wealth compromising incentives etc. not clear to me whether scaling prosocial governance requires some level of homogeneity because of innate ingroup preference. But what’s super apparent is we are stuck in this mode of critique
[15/1/26, 13:16:40] ~ manav: Even Zizek cannot muster more than “the paradigm itself was doomed to fail for xyz and it plastered over the worst human impulses” but all he has to say solutions wise is “we must radically reimagine”
[15/1/26, 13:18:13] ~ manav: Sadly the only “radical reimagination” of liberal political norms has come from neoreactionaries who in the absence of competition hold significant institutional sway
[15/1/26, 13:26:37] ~ manav: What does it say about the state of the left rn that thinkers who reheat absolute monarchy on libertarian grounds are closer to power
[15/1/26, 13:41:06] ~ Elma : Giys can u share ur location plz
[15/1/26, 13:49:02] Yi Hein: Student centre is packed right now, don’t think there are any seats
[15/1/26, 13:49:17] Yi Hein: Will be going early to kings cross library to reserve seats
[15/1/26, 13:51:40] ~ Elma : Alrighty no worries
[15/1/26, 13:54:20] ~ Arinze: Sorry, it was hypothetical 😭
[15/1/26, 13:55:14] ~ Arinze: Yes it’s a dark world, I wish I had all the answers genuinely.
[15/1/26, 13:56:23] ~ Arinze: We are in no position to actually stop anything, I think it can be futile and naive to think you have any control and it is almost energy misdirected
[15/1/26, 13:59:17] ~ Arinze: I would object. The point of discussing isn’t to do something, ie seen in parliament and also how you need 100,000 votes for it to be simply discussed with no guarantee of action and if you look at the statistics of what is subsequently acted upon, the percentages are low 😭
[15/1/26, 14:00:01] ~ Arinze: Ceasefire in Gaza is a clear example of this , all that peaceful protesting and they just kept discussing
[15/1/26, 14:02:58] ~ Arinze: I think if you read a lot of French philosophy (the country which is probably the best at achieving the desires of the general population), they  advocate for resistance/violence as a means of toppling systems which the population does not desire ‎<This message was edited>
[15/1/26, 14:03:24] ~ manav: Yeah I agree, I was just resisting the moralising
[15/1/26, 14:04:05] ~ manav: Would you call those successful or useful discussions? I feel like you’re proving my point
[15/1/26, 14:05:33] ~ Arinze: Unsuccessful, the trade offs until the action is taken would imply that it’s actually the severity of the situation that eventually prompts action, rather than the discussion.
[15/1/26, 14:05:51] ~ Arinze: The appeasement of the moustache man in the 1930s is another example of this ‎<This message was edited>
[15/1/26, 14:06:36] ~ Arinze: Essentially you need both
[15/1/26, 14:07:21] ~ manav: Yeah exactly! So we should at least try to have useful discussions right ‎<This message was edited>
[15/1/26, 14:07:40] ~ manav: That’s all I’m saying
[15/1/26, 14:07:59] ~ Arinze: Fairs
‎[15/1/26, 16:16:16] Yi Hein: Heres where to find us *today at 5.30pm*:

Location: 5 Pancras Square
N1C 4AG ‎video omitted
[15/1/26, 16:33:59] Haziq KXHL: no love for sartre???? 

ok fine . i’ll concede this much ,,, i genuinely do not have a cleanly articulated alternative either . but my frustration isnt “we lack a perfect plan” its watching people trivialise the actual good actions of individuals who are sacrificing real time , money . stability . using lazy takes like “why dont they just play the system lol” ..

that argument always feels less like strategy . more like a post hoc moral alibi for not doing anything uncomfortable ,,, like i wont take risks . you shouldnt either . therefore whatever im already doing or not doing becomes the most moral stance actually . bonus points if i can reframe my llm gf pursuits as praxis . if u squint . hard enough
[15/1/26, 16:41:17] ~ Elma : I had to leave King’s Cross area cos I have an event to go to now!! Hope you all have a lovely time
[15/1/26, 16:43:24] Haziq KXHL: did u at least meet the kxhl ppl??
[15/1/26, 16:44:35] ~ Elma : Wdymm

[15/1/26, 20:40:13] ~ Ada Ge: Q: for what reason is it easier to recognize than to recall facts?
[15/1/26, 21:15:46] ~ Alex Pylypenko: define "recognise" in this context?
[15/1/26, 21:15:57] ~ Alex Pylypenko: do you mean "someone says something and you reply 'oh, i've heard that before, of course!'"
[15/1/26, 21:21:44] Haziq KXHL: recognition is mapping from external cues -> memory states, recall is mapping from purely internal cognitive states -> memory states and that second mapping is way harder bc ur brain has to bootstrap the whole search itself
[15/1/26, 21:48:59] ~ Alex Pylypenko: sorry this is completely off topic but I'm sure people here will have takes
i'm currently in the slightly gruelling process of trying to think of web design for my personal website (i have absolutely no eye for design btw) - does anyone have any recommendations of other cool people's websites I could maybe get iNsPiReD by?

[15/1/26, 21:56:35] Haziq KXHL: this is also off topic but I think-ed it and regrettably cannot unthink it… ‎<This message was edited>
[15/1/26, 21:58:28] Haziq KXHL: i just wanna say why ppl cling so hard to monophyly / UCD (universal common descent) in OOL (origin of life) , bc abiogenesis is already doing an insane amount of work , like life out of literal chemistry soup , once is already a miracle we barely know how to tell a story about , so if u give up UCD u are basically forced to say ok cool this happened multiple times independently which is not just “harder” but opens a massive explanatory gap

u still have to explain why all independent life looks the same , same nucleotides , same chirality , same amino acids , same core metabolism , same translation machinery , same genetic code , like what are the odds that independent origins converge that hard down to specific molecular choices

UCD lets u avoid that whole mess , one origin , one frozen set of contingencies , everything else just inherits it , which is why UCD is doing so much quiet labor in origin of life and why ppl get defensive when u poke it , 

and this is why cracks in UCD matter so much , bc without it the question stops being “how did life arise once” and turns into “why does independent life all look identical” which is a way scarier question ‎<This message was edited>

[15/1/26, 22:06:52] ~ manav: Measured suggestion.
[15/1/26, 22:09:40] Haziq KXHL: ur prose is nice btw ,, id even go as far as to say a close second to mine 🤝
[15/1/26, 22:10:02] ~ manav: Much obliged:)
[15/1/26, 22:41:01] Haziq KXHL: ok so the genetic code being universal always gets used as one of the strongest arguments for UCD (universal common descent) right , like one code one ancestry etc

but if u actually sit with it for more than 5 seconds it kind of turns into a problem

bc there are only two times genetic code divergence could have happened , either before the genetic code of LUCA (last universal common ancestor) was fixed or after

before LUCA early life was communal as hell , HGT (horizontal gene transfer) everywhere , and if different lineages are using different codes then borrowed genes just turn into nonsense proteins , which kills HGT , which kills fast evolution , so multiple divergent codes cant really persist there

ok fine so what about after LUCA , after the code is fixed , well at that point translation is literally an operating system , even small changes break everything at once , proteins collapse globally , so organisms cannot actually explore fundamentally different codes there either

so divergence couldnt really happen before LUCA and it couldnt really happen after LUCA

and yet we observe more than 18 genetic codes 😵‍💫
[15/1/26, 23:08:45] Haziq KXHL: btw guys if there is any specific aspect of OOL you’d like me or @⁨~Alp Duygu⁩ to discuss on Sunday then pls do let us know
[16/1/26, 00:33:35] Yi Hein: @⁨Alex KXHL⁩ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHDNbvv6Rjo
[16/1/26, 00:40:02] Alex KXHL: ty!
[16/1/26, 00:58:07] Haziq KXHL: https://youtu.be/cwq2FfpTIAE?si=mk0AKq0sujApWTfV
uncanny resemblance to @⁨Alex KXHL⁩ or is it just me 🤨
[16/1/26, 11:15:27] Haziq KXHL: this “there are no alternatives” is just not true like factually. its a rigged standard where anything historical “doesnt count” because wow it didnt last forever and anything new “doesnt count” because theres no precedent so magically the only acceptable outcome is whatever we already have plus some advice about playing the system harder. thats not realism thats just status quo bias dressed up as maturity. and acting like the only proposals on the table are zizek going “we must radically reimagine” is insane when theres an entire field of inequality economics (piketty saez zucman atkinson mazzucato etc) with extremely boring extremely specific policy proposals. ignoring that corpus and then asking for a “proven alternative” is just pretending not to see whats right there ‎<This message was edited>
[16/1/26, 11:18:36] Haziq KXHL: and sorry but this whole “one finds oneself already moving already implicated already answerable” thing is very poetic way of laundering complicity. you take a boring descriptive fact (yes we live inside systems congrats) and quietly turn it into a moral demand that critique must be productive and instrumental and immediately actionable. being implicated does not mean i owe the system a redemption arc or a strategy deck. the merseault position is actually stronger because it refuses the emotional blackmail of “if you dont turn this into a startup or policy memo youre being defeatist”. sometimes the most honest stance is to say this is absurd and i will not help you narrate it as necessary or good
[16/1/26, 11:23:32] Haziq KXHL: also these stories about social contingencies and inevitabilities are doing the exact same work as zizek’s toilet hydraulics if you think about it. just useless subjective evaluations of data no one asked for. like congrats you narrated the pipes that doesnt tell me why i should respect the bathroom
[16/1/26, 11:37:16] ~ manav: Did I say there are no alternatives
[16/1/26, 11:37:24] ~ manav: I said we need to discuss the alternatives seriously
[16/1/26, 11:38:59] ~ manav: “One finds oneself already implicated” means that simply critiquing is worthless posturing
[16/1/26, 11:41:02] ~ manav: A refusal to articulate an alternative or a positive vision is precisely what you claim not to be doing. It is treating our present conditions as necessary. When Graeber says “the ultimate hidden truth of the world is that it is something that we make, and could just as easily make differently” this only becomes true when we posit the alternative world! ‎<This message was edited>
[16/1/26, 11:42:42] ~ manav: So you’re saying that understanding the conditions that enabled the outcomes you want is useless to attaining those outcomes again?
[16/1/26, 11:44:51] ~ manav: When I say that playing the VC lottery with positive motivations is superior to empty posturing that is not elevating playing the game it is an indictment of empty posturing
[16/1/26, 11:46:51] ~ manav: Because when you say that the Mersault position is stronger what you are really implying is that it would be better for everyone who is currently trying to better the world within the constraints of our current system to stop doing that and instead take up the Mersault position
[16/1/26, 11:46:57] ~ manav: Is that seriously the better world?
[16/1/26, 11:48:01] ~ manav: “Their efforts would be better spent doing xyz discrete things” is a much more respectable position and one that I may even agree with
[16/1/26, 14:36:35] Haziq KXHL: ok guilty as charged yes i do feel defeated. i think the odds are stacked so aggressively against doing any actual good and that pushes me into a very “sisyphus must smile” place where you do the right thing knowing full well it will probably amount to nothing in the long run.we all recognise the futility and split in opposite directions. one camp still chooses necessary work without guarantees knowing it will be ignored and maybe fail anyway. the other camp concludes well if nothing meaningfully changes then i might as well profit inside the system as designed and then doesn’t even have the decency to own that choice quietly. they demand moral branding for it
[16/1/26, 14:40:19] Haziq KXHL: and i do not buy this fantasy that playing the vc lottery with llm girlfriend startups is morally neutral or secretly prosocial. there are no good intentions there at all. the goal is status, insulation, money and a story you can tell yourself about being “realistic” and the demand for moral credit on top of that is what makes it disgusting. don’t ask me to respect extraction just because you narrated it with the word constraints. , and sneering at people who knowingly choose unrewarding necessary work as naive is pure moral inversion
[16/1/26, 14:48:47] Haziq KXHL: not saying understanding conditions is useless, just noting if the punchline of your analysis of those conditions is always “therefore nothing can be done except optimise for myself”, that tells me nothing interesting about the conditions and a lot about you
[16/1/26, 15:03:40] Haziq KXHL: also excuse me for any second person incrimination here. my incrimination is aimed at a pervasive attitude that is very present in this and other tech centric communities. this whole convo literally started with casually undermining public sector research and acting like it is some cute passion project you do “for fun” before you grow up and chase where the money is. that framing only really works if you’ve never done anything that actually mattered in your life and don’t plan to. they don’t want to do the work, they don’t want to fund the work and they definitely don’t want to sit with the fact that some fields only survive because people accept being broke burned out and ignored. weird amount of confidence for people whose main contribution is pointing at money and saying “see”
[16/1/26, 19:01:18] Haziq KXHL: hey @⁨~Anna Magpie⁩ been reading kauffman’s origin of order stuff so here’s me doing due diligence bc i definitely handwaved it the first time lol

tl;dr NK model:
*N = number of components*
*K = number of interactions between components*

idea is NK defines the attractor landscape of some complex system
* high K = chaos, tons of attractors but search/navigation is cooked
* low K = smooth landscape, easy to navigate but basically no attractors
* medium K = “edge of chaos”, "structured complexity" kauffman’s sweet spot

so kauffman’s story is: darwinian evolution needs some ordered substrate (proto-life / simple replicator) and that substrate is supposed to be one of the attractor states of the prebiotic soup which he thinks naturally lives near edge-of-chaos K
[16/1/26, 19:05:03] Haziq KXHL: ok BUT there’s a tradeoff between *number of attractors* and *coherence of attractors*

if you want to say “yeah one of the attractors just happened to be proto-life” that only really works if there are tons of attractors so it’s not shocking that one is special

but kauffman explicitly doesn’t like that regime bc that’s high K / chaos where attractors are too many, shallow and basically impossible to find & stabilise
[16/1/26, 19:05:59] Haziq KXHL: so instead he caps K at edge of chaos which gives you nice coherent attractors… but now you only have a small highly constrained set of attractors

and at that point it’s no longer obvious at all why one of those few attractors should correspond to a proto-life state rather than just inert dynamical junk

so NK kinda forces you to choose:
* many attractors but no navigability (high K)
* navigability but too few attractors (edge of chaos)

and neither regime actually solves abiogenesis by “just wait long enough and you’ll hit life”
[16/1/26, 19:09:03] Haziq KXHL: ok so net net i think there’s only like two ways to crack abiogenesis and both are cursed
*option 1)*
you need a landscape with lots of attractors and it has to be easy to navigate
bc proto-life is presumably rare so you need many basins but you also need correlated structure so exploration isn’t exponentially hard

and kauffman’s NK project is basically a negative result here bc NK literally formalizes that you cannot have high attractor density and navigability / coherence
[16/1/26, 19:10:21] Haziq KXHL: *option 2)*
the landscape actually contains some insane latent information density
like the system is biased toward certain “functional” configurations at a really deep level

which is basically what bob hazen @ CMU is gesturing at w mineral evolution + functional information
the idea that complex systems kinda want to drift toward some "function"
i really wish this worked out bc it’s insanely cool
but its also… circular???
like function is defined retroactively by what persists and then we say systems move toward function

[18/1/26, 17:14:01] Haziq KXHL: while y’all were slacking on OOL… I and Prof. @⁨~Alp Duygu⁩ were working on a mathematical result about order from chaos, 
rough sketch ☝️
many months of interesting work ahead, stay tuned for 
The KXHL Theorem™️
[18/1/26, 18:42:36] Yi Hein: Explanation for the mathematically disabled?
[18/1/26, 18:58:55] Haziq KXHL: bro no one is more mathematically disabled than the placenta biologist but like here’s the T:
[18/1/26, 18:59:42] Haziq KXHL: 1/ imagine all possible chemical states of the prebiotic soup as a gigantic space
like. every point = “some configuration of molecules doing stuff”
[18/1/26, 19:00:12] Haziq KXHL: 2/ “life” is not most of that space
life is a tiny freak corner of it
like a grain of sand in the sahara
that tininess is what we mean by “information”
[18/1/26, 19:00:47] Haziq KXHL: 3/ kauffman’s NK model says: systems have “attractors”
aka stable behaviors the system naturally falls into
think: valleys in a landscape
[18/1/26, 19:01:34] Haziq KXHL: 4/ he argues there’s a sweet spot (“edge of chaos”)
where:
	•	valleys are deep enough to be stable
	•	but not so chaotic that you can’t ever find them

cool so far
[18/1/26, 19:04:17] Haziq KXHL: 5/ we did a fermi style back of the envelope calculation and asked: how big are the basins of attraction that actually hit life like states?
[18/1/26, 19:04:55] Haziq KXHL: 6/ answer: they shrink exponentially with the information content of life
every extra bit of specificity nukes basin size multiplicatively

not “linear bad”
not “polynomial bad”
exponential bad
[18/1/26, 19:05:37] Haziq KXHL: 7/ this happens even at the edge of chaos
you either get:
	•	many tiny unstable basins (chaos) or
	•	a few big ones that almost never point at life (order)
[18/1/26, 19:06:23] Haziq KXHL: 8/ so the punchline:
self organization does not beat the information problem
edge of chaos helps evolution after life exists
it does not explain abiogenesis (life from soup) “for free”

[19/1/26, 11:24:54] Haziq KXHL: oh interesting… as someone who memorises large corpora for sport 😭 ive had the opposite experience. they literally try to make us trip in tests/competitions by asking us to recall text w/o prior sequence. yes linking is a bit of effort (rote memorisation) but makes recall helluva a lot easier
[19/1/26, 11:29:02] ~ manav: That’s because 1-1 cued recall > nested cue recall > free recall in terms of ease
[19/1/26, 11:29:35] ~ manav: This is one of the Anki Problems, if you aren’t careful you cannot recall a piece of information without the precise cue of the card
[19/1/26, 11:30:41] Yi Hein: also you need to account for memorisation time. For lists, the more orthogonal each list item is, the harder it is to memorise, because it is hard to draw a link.

whereas most stories have a natural link through the narrative, so it’s easy to do 1 shot memorisation
[19/1/26, 11:33:06] ~ manav: Yeah I think this is why the learning meta is shifting towards good encoding > active recall if you have to pick between the two
[19/1/26, 11:33:43] ~ manav: Chunking + explicitly associating new info with established schemas
[19/1/26, 11:34:07] ~ manav: Then only ankify orphan nodes
[19/1/26, 11:35:06] Yi Hein: yeah but the problem in medicine is that most knowledge there is no good link, quite discrete. The underlying schema (physiology) sometimes is more complicated than the facts themselves. Mnemonics tries to establish pseudo-schemas but that doesn’t improve understanding either
[19/1/26, 11:36:09] ~ manav: Justin Sung argues that the relata don’t need anything tying them together in actuality you can just create arbitrary schemes
[19/1/26, 11:36:41] ~ Ada Ge: wow okay
[19/1/26, 11:37:00] ~ Ada Ge: is there a core piece of literature like a review on this i can save and never open again
[19/1/26, 11:37:03] ~ manav: I’m a bit skeptical, probably compromises the utility of knowing the stuff in the first place lol
[19/1/26, 11:37:39] ~ manav: Not top of mind sorry
[19/1/26, 11:38:16] ~ manav: The only learning thing I truly believe in is bloom’s 2 sigma
[19/1/26, 11:38:32] Yi Hein: @⁨~Euan Ong⁩ this is probably why there is less generalisation in medicine, people have to memorise with fake, made-up schemas that doesn’t link to much understanding
[19/1/26, 11:38:44] ~ manav: Yeah see sketchy for example
[19/1/26, 11:39:05] ~ manav: Dawg my doctor is treating me based on lurid narrative cartoons
[19/1/26, 11:39:21] Yi Hein: sketchy is shockingly effective though, I get 1-2 shot memorisation there
[19/1/26, 11:39:43] Yi Hein: spatial pseudo-schemas are really good
[19/1/26, 11:40:44] ~ manav: There’s this US MD/PhD called Vineet Tiruvadi working on creating a coherent control-theoretic substrate for understanding medicine
[19/1/26, 11:40:50] ~ manav: https://virati.medium.com/principles-of-medicine-for-engineers-14b48dfb8e7c?source=user_profile_page---------13-------------349b8cad8316----------------------
[19/1/26, 11:40:56] ~ manav: Series of medium posts on it that I quite like
[19/1/26, 11:41:04] ~ manav: His PhD is really good too
[19/1/26, 11:47:23] Yi Hein: I wonder if we can apply the same constraints to LLMs, make it so bad at memorising that it has to relies on schemas, and see if that improves generalisation
[19/1/26, 11:49:20] Yi Hein: like maybe catastrophic forgetting is a good thing, to encourage more schema formation which sticks long term while make the raw knowledge flaky
[19/1/26, 11:52:17] ~ manav: Wait but aren’t schemas sort of like cutting holes in the decision space?
[19/1/26, 11:54:17] ~ manav: I start with a lossy classification (some rule) and then partition it based on exceptions
[19/1/26, 11:54:29] ~ manav: Catastrophic forgetting would subvert this
[19/1/26, 11:58:38] ~ Ada Ge: can someone define what a schema in this case is please, for the casual reader?
[19/1/26, 12:02:23] ~ manav: When I say schema I mean any thought pattern that classifies information
[19/1/26, 12:07:28] Yi Hein: I don’t know the formal definition but I just see it as a structured way of organising knowledge that maximises the links between each piece of knowledge, also minimising the size of total knowledge. Sort of like abstractions where you can reuse the common parts
[19/1/26, 12:13:12] Yi Hein: I’m thinking along the lines of - if you have an abstract piece of knowledge (schema) that can be reused in many situations, then those weights will be strengthened in most training examples. Whereas knowledge that only applies to a few training examples will have their weights dampened
[19/1/26, 12:14:52] Yi Hein: now that sounds more like an inherent property of Hebbian learning
[19/1/26, 12:27:33] Haziq KXHL: wdym “working on creating”? prof uri alon (ex theoretical physicist legend) & co at weizmann pioneered the use of control theory and geometric analysis of dynamical systems (à la poincaré or izhikevich in our field of neuro) and even wrote a slay book on it, _systems medicine_. their ovulation number model is like poetry for me lol

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35909517/
[19/1/26, 12:33:38] ~ manav: Looks cool
[19/1/26, 12:45:26] Haziq KXHL: imo we have good biophysical models at the cellular and subcellular scale (hodgkin huxley being the most basic example) and we have good theories of computation and control at the level of physiology. the work that remains is showing the emergence of the computation from the substrate
[19/1/26, 12:46:10] ~ manav: I agree
[19/1/26, 12:46:47] Haziq KXHL: for example moffitt cancer center has given me the herculean task (for free btw bc it’s apparently not typical to have undergrads on retainer) of working on a swarm intelligence theory of cancer to explain how a tumor probes the environment at the cell level, propagates that info to the network level, performs a computation, decides a control policy, and then propagates it back to individual cells for coordinated action
[19/1/26, 13:02:35] ~ Ada Ge: that's very cool
[19/1/26, 13:03:10] ~ Ada Ge: is there equivalent literature on how abstractions that do this which you can apply / try to find evidence for or falsify
[19/1/26, 13:15:41] Haziq KXHL: on reasons to think there is swarm intelligence in cancer:
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39364294/
[19/1/26, 13:17:06] Haziq KXHL: 👆 *that’s bob gatenby, mathematical oncologist who’s mailing as we speak like Haziq where’s the model you said you’ll send over last week 😭
[19/1/26, 13:18:06] Haziq KXHL: i was like sorry boss i was tryna solve OOL and you don’t even pay for me this btw 😆
[19/1/26, 13:19:21] Haziq KXHL: https://drmichaellevin.org/publications/cancer.html
we have a pretty good sense that the cognitive glue is bioelectric patterning from this corpus of work
[19/1/26, 13:26:49] Haziq KXHL: canonical abstractions are agent based models and the like think boids or the vicsek model of bird flocking

but we’re learning this is a very different beast. usually people tweak the substrate until the right computation emerges and the computation is very implementation dependent

with bioelectric patterning it’s almost the opposite. the behavior is insanely robust almost implementation invariant. you block an ion channel and it restores function through compensatory pathways and still converges to the same macroscopic outcome ☠️
[19/1/26, 13:36:39] Haziq KXHL: so the modelling approach i proposed is a very weird one. we train a message passing neural network to learn the computational invariants, then use that to constrain a parametric flexible biophysical model. the goal isn’t one mechanism but to reveal the whole equivalence class of possible implementations that give rise to the observed behavior
[19/1/26, 13:49:16] ~ Ada Ge: ok. sounds like a decent idea. if i sat on the grantmaking committee and knew about as much as i do now, i would give you a grant on this
[19/1/26, 13:50:19] ~ Ada Ge: this reminds me of looking into stimulants and tolerance
[19/1/26, 13:50:58] ~ Ada Ge: that you can get tolerant to a lot of things, most of which cannot be evolved for, except for the toleration mechanism itself
[19/1/26, 14:02:58] Haziq KXHL: Ada for the love of god don’t OOL bait me when im in thermodynamics lab, i will acc burn the building down by accident 😵
[19/1/26, 14:03:34] Haziq KXHL: also you shouldve come to the AMA and asked these Qs 😑

[19/1/26, 14:13:33] Haziq KXHL: join KXHL for starters…
[19/1/26, 14:13:51] Yi Hein: Was just about to say that HAHAHA
[19/1/26, 14:16:27] Yi Hein: Given everyone is gonna run multiple instances of Opus 4.5 to vibe code, probably the idea and working on the pitch is best use of time?
[19/1/26, 14:43:34] ~ Alex Pylypenko: Get a Claude Code subscription, preferably multiple.
[19/1/26, 14:45:07] ~ Xi2???: get a claude max subscription
[19/1/26, 14:45:09] Yi Hein: also i realised github copilot agents recently patched their opus 4.5 usage, i was using it to run 1.5 hr agent sessions for 3/100 of monthly tokens.
[19/1/26, 14:45:11] ~ Xi2???: the 200 pounds per month one
[19/1/26, 14:45:37] ~ Xi2???: and tell them to make as many projects as possible (maximise for number of projects) before ichack in a sprint
[19/1/26, 14:50:33] ~ Alex Pylypenko: Why?

[19/1/26, 14:50:52] ~ Alex Pylypenko: Slightly confused.
[19/1/26, 14:51:49] Yi Hein: it’s not a bug it’s just super generous
[19/1/26, 14:52:02] ~ Xi2???: hackathons are inherently about ideation and implementation speed
[19/1/26, 14:52:38] ~ Xi2???: and u dont get better at coming up with good ideas by trying to come up with good ideas but to come up with so many ideas u eventually know how to come up with good ones or sm

[19/1/26, 16:56:50] Haziq KXHL: most important meta point i can tell you friend is stop tryna “succeed”, just go for exposure, have fun, goof around. although i do understand the imperial grindset lol

genuinely no merit in being competitive at the cost of fun
[19/1/26, 16:59:29] ~ Ada Ge: i have told him!
[19/1/26, 16:59:45] Haziq KXHL: id rather just learn via osmosis by being adjacent to cracked ppl, like im the interns intern everywhere i work and you just absorb things through sheer talent density. which is why joining kxhl is an excellent idea

[19/1/26, 17:04:29] ~ Ada Ge: "interns intern" is very funny
[19/1/26, 17:06:27] Haziq KXHL: lol there’s acc an arabic proverb:
َفَوْقَ كُلِّ ذِي عِلْمٍ عَلِيمٌ

which is high classical arabic for: u think ur _him_ but theres always someone _*more him*_

and im at the very bottom of the him chain rn 😭
[19/1/26, 17:07:23] Haziq KXHL: *@⁨Niv Ucl Builder⁩ resident proverb-ist this one’s for you

We actually cannot escape contingencies in this gc
[19/1/26, 17:11:56] Haziq KXHL: double it and give it to endometriosis tbh, cancer is not desperate for another NIH grant and i only need lunch money
[19/1/26, 17:18:40] Haziq KXHL: 😭 this is what happens when the only lens u own is analytical philosophy… proverb lifted from the quran and became a common arabic expression, context is just intellectual humility tbh
[19/1/26, 17:19:48] ~ manav: Tbh facts my mind is ran thru by phil
[19/1/26, 17:30:02] Haziq KXHL: orgel’s second rule, “evolution is cleverer than you are,” so pls can we stop saying what evolution can or cannot do at the phenotypic level 😭
what we can talk about is what a stochastic search operator over genotype space can realistically achieve which neo-darwinism says is the primary source of variation and i rate it highly.
what you’re positing sounds like a co-option hypothesis where similar control systems evolve and get reused but molecular biology pushes back because even ubiquitous control motifs are implemented using radically different substrates in each pathway ‎<This message was edited>
[19/1/26, 17:32:32] ~ Alex Pylypenko: is this "him" in the God sense or in the 2025 "bro thinks he's him" meme sense?
[19/1/26, 17:32:45] ~ Alex Pylypenko: I'm also a proverb enjoyer, just don't know quite as many as Nivyan
[19/1/26, 17:35:55] Haziq KXHL: like i said before its really tough for stochastic search to assemble even a single functional protein, let alone whole pathways where theres literally no selection gradient unless all the parts are in place for a signal to be transduced. it’s genuinely a rube goldberg nightmare 😭

also @⁨Yi Hein⁩ mentioned the idea of one mega protein getting split up to form a signalling pathway but that still doesnt really fly bc we dont have intermediates for vibes. Wendell Lim at UCSF has shown theres computation happening at literally every step of transduction like signal amplification, high pass filtering, low pass filtering, etc. its not just lego blocks snapping apart
[19/1/26, 17:37:41] Haziq KXHL: bro thinks hes him, not I AM THAT I AM

[20/1/26, 10:07:04] Niv Ucl Builder: we are creating the largest proverb dataset known to man!
[20/1/26, 10:07:22] Niv Ucl Builder: ive been scanning and digitizing hundreds of proverb collections
[20/1/26, 10:08:15] Niv Ucl Builder: proverbs (by their definition) are also in the public domain so it allows us to sideline through the legality of scraping
[20/1/26, 10:08:29] Niv Ucl Builder: but ive only been doing books for which copyright has expired

darwin writes beautifully ngl
if i discovered evolution id have been like
“it was literally one thing and then it just kept happening”
[20/1/26, 10:14:22] Haziq KXHL: 👆 happy to contribute my proverb
it’s not public domain but i’ll look the other way
[20/1/26, 10:19:29] Niv Ucl Builder: this does raise quite a few interesting questions as to what a proverb is or can be! the definition for idioms is similarly vague, but im working on an inclusion criteria which i can share shortly!
[20/1/26, 10:20:29] Niv Ucl Builder: cool cool, ill talk about this with you! i think itll be fun challenge
[20/1/26, 10:21:44] Haziq KXHL: a proverb is any sentence that has survived being paraphrased incorrectly 50 times imo 🤷‍♂️
[20/1/26, 10:33:32] Haziq KXHL: @⁨~Laith⁩ blink twice if this translation is wrong
[20/1/26, 10:39:26] ~ Laith: Close enough lol
[20/1/26, 10:44:14] Haziq KXHL: while evo devo / hox mutations are cool... it’s not doing the kind of lifting ppl think it is for origin of new body plans
hox mostly sets positional gradients so you’re shuffling the same arms / legs / segments around
[20/1/26, 10:45:24] Haziq KXHL: for the LLM pilled:
hox genes are your positional encoders
they tell you where you are in the sequence,, not how to invent new tokens
[20/1/26, 10:46:48] Haziq KXHL: ppl be like “evo devo fixes neo darwinism”
my brother in christ neo darwinism predicted ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny and that aged like milk
what are we salvaging exactly
[20/1/26, 11:07:42] Haziq KXHL: oh sorry realised “ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny” is niche brainrot from our tortured biologists dept (yes 100% a swiftie)
tl;dr ppl used to think embryo development literally replays evolutionary history especially this bloke Ernst Haeckel so like you were acc speedrunning evolution in the womb
🐟 -> 🐸 -> 🦎 -> 🐭 -> 🧍‍♂️
so yeh according to Haeckel u were fish first then frog then lizard then u 😭
[20/1/26, 11:13:44] Haziq KXHL: ppl like to clown this idea bc it’s not true but imo the real problem is it’s acc a legit prediction of the framwork
1. evolution works by gradual additions on top of existing forms
2. and selection mainly acts at adult / reproductive age
3. then early development is under weak selection and should preserve ancestral structure
4. so development ends up looking like a layered record of evolutionary history
[20/1/26, 11:21:30] Haziq KXHL: this is where ppl came up with evo devo
adult phenotypes are controlled by early developmental genes + regulatory networks
so evolution works by tweaking upstream controls and development + body plans co evolve
[20/1/26, 12:08:59] Haziq KXHL: and everyone was like eureka we fixed it ✨
but there’s a hidden bug...

haeckel was still right about one thing: selection mainly acts at adult / reproductive age
so if adult fitness depends on far upstream dev genes you now have massive sensitive dependence on initial conditions 

evolution gets into a parking lot fight with the lorenz attractor 🌀

‎[20/1/26, 13:16:14] Haziq KXHL: talking about hurricanes @⁨~Alp Duygu⁩ 
jeremy england’s adaptive dissipation argument and saying life is basically like a hurricane is not very defensible imo
bcos hurricanes dissipate gradients until they literally delete themselves
if you keep paying for internal organisation by dumping heat with no control, you eventually have no energy left for interesting internal dynamics

not saying life is a perpetual motion machine or anything
but it does keep being dynamic by continuously pulling in energy, storing it and releasing it in a highly regulated way
it’s not clear how that kind of regulated, persistent dynamics would self organise just from “dissipate better”

you’re basically asking the system to adapt toward being a worse, more “life-like” dissipator instead of an optimal hurricane-like one (sniff sniff teleology) ‎image omitted
[20/1/26, 13:24:38] Haziq KXHL: sorry for being obsessed w this but this is what happens when an aspiring astrobiologist gets funneled into the biomedical pipeline 😭

[20/1/26, 13:31:13] ~ Alex Pylypenko: "American physicist and Orthodox rabbi" goes hard 🔥🔥🔥
[20/1/26, 13:31:33] ~ Alex Pylypenko: Must be an extremely interesting person to talk to
[20/1/26, 13:32:15] ~ Alex Pylypenko: oh wait I just read on.....
[20/1/26, 13:32:17] ~ Alex Pylypenko: Bruh
[20/1/26, 13:36:15] Haziq KXHL: its just... as someone trying to do real work here
i’m chronically annoyed by the pendulum swing between “science killed god” and “science failed so it’s god”
like pls give me a break
[20/1/26, 13:41:07] ~ manav: Genuinely good and rare take. Rarely do people point out non overlapping magisteria in the other direction
[20/1/26, 13:41:42] ~ manav: If your metaphysics intrudes into science regardless of what it is, imo it compromises your ability to be a good scientist
[20/1/26, 13:50:51] Haziq KXHL: yesssss
bro tell me about it bc how i see it play out IRL is that the “science killed god” crowd is mostly the one doing science
and they’re so desperate to make that true that they end up proposing the most idiotic theories imaginable
like it had to happen somehow right??

then the theory inevitably collapses, everyone realises it was nonsense and suddenly it’s “science failed so it’s god” again
no actual work gets done, just pendulum swinging forever

that’s literally why me and @⁨~Alp Duygu⁩ are trying to build a mathematical falsification machine
at least then we have a filter for stupid theories at the onset before they become discourse 😭
[20/1/26, 13:59:03] ~ Alex Pylypenko: who is this mysterious +44 7391 838685 person :D
[20/1/26, 13:59:20] ~ Alex Pylypenko: but yeah great take
[20/1/26, 14:05:24] Haziq KXHL: oh sorry i don’t think i’ve introduced him to everyone
that’s my friend alp duygu
ucl undergrad doing chemistry & mathematics
i call him prof duygu bc istg you wouldn’t be wrong for thinking he already is one

he’s on the theoretical / quantum chemistry to origin of life / complex systems / emergent phenomena pipeline and i’m basically just tagging along
research wise: OOL obviously, bioelectricity x cancer (twin), molecular dynamics
[20/1/26, 14:06:46] ~ Alex Pylypenko: Certainly much more insightful than +44 7931 838685, thanks :)
[20/1/26, 14:08:08] Haziq KXHL: oops sorry 😭 i have his number saved so i just assumed name would show up for everyone like an idiot ‎<This message was edited>
[20/1/26, 14:09:16] Haziq KXHL: also he’s the one who co-hosted the ool seminar with me last sunday… the one y’all didn’t show up for 👀
[20/1/26, 14:19:57] Haziq KXHL: tbf he’s the type to remind you that kolmogorov complexity is relative so the phone number @⁨~Alp Duygu⁩ could contain his entire life story in theory... just with a cursed decoding function ☠️
[20/1/26, 14:20:26] ~ Elma : Guys would u come to a pitch event with no food/drink? But can purchase if u want
[20/1/26, 14:20:42] ~ Elma : Sorry to interrupt your flow state Haziq 🙏🏼
[20/1/26, 14:21:48] Haziq KXHL: all good, my flow state was becoming a public safety hazard
[20/1/26, 14:22:35] Haziq KXHL: uno reverse card 🃏 why should we come? drop the 2 min pitch
[20/1/26, 14:25:32] ~ Elma : - Get a taste of entrepreneurship and see people get their ideas/businesses grilled on stage
- ⁠Judges are successful founders/investors - good networking 
- ⁠it’s in partnership with Imperial entrepreneurs so you get an opportunity to network with top talent and perhaps meet your potential cofounder
[20/1/26, 14:25:44] ~ Elma : That’s like the rlly shitty way of selling it
[20/1/26, 14:26:12] Haziq KXHL: are you asking _us specifically_ (like a customer interview) or is this a general “would ppl come” question?
[20/1/26, 14:26:38] ~ Elma : Mmmm more of a would ppl come
[20/1/26, 14:27:13] ~ Elma : But you guys are into entrepreneurship I presume so it’s on brand to ask ygm
[20/1/26, 14:28:19] Haziq KXHL: i would come!
however pls note my primary motivation would be to clown the vcs and founders so security advised
[20/1/26, 14:28:47] ~ Elma : Loooool
[20/1/26, 14:29:04] ~ Elma : Fairs mate
[20/1/26, 14:29:55] Haziq KXHL: real talk tho what food are we working with and is it venue-price-inflated

[20/1/26, 16:31:40] Niv Ucl Builder: event hosted by ucl neurotech today!
[20/1/26, 18:38:56] Haziq KXHL: https://eightsix.science

ngl this is looking very *_exit-scam chic_* 😵‍💫
love how startups are always somehow ~20 years ahead of neuroscience. the biological substrate of consciousness is very much in question (astroengrams + Levin’s zebrafish say hi) but somehow we’re already doing brain hot-swaps and promising identity continuity. incredible confidence tbh

i feel like @⁨~manav⁩ might have something interesting to say about this whole ship of theseus situation lol
[20/1/26, 18:39:23] Niv Ucl Builder: yes, this session is ass
[20/1/26, 18:39:37] Niv Ucl Builder: i mostly came here for comedy rather than receiving anything of substance
[20/1/26, 18:39:44] Niv Ucl Builder: thats how neurotech startups tend to be
[20/1/26, 18:40:00] Niv Ucl Builder: it is funny to see him talking about mind uploading, i like the effort but like yk
[20/1/26, 18:40:17] Haziq KXHL: this sorta thing only flies because it only has to clear deranged transhumanist TED talk villain review instead of peer review
[20/1/26, 18:44:23] Haziq KXHL: although I feel like these guys lowkey cracked transhumanism but only in the sense of going beyond _Homo sapiens_ and becoming *Homo post-human-but-pre-thought*
[20/1/26, 18:59:27] ~ manav: All I’ll say is that let’s figure out identity first and then we can talk about preserving anything in particular
[20/1/26, 19:00:55] ~ manav: Genuinely surprisingly difficult to ground identity on something that isn’t always in flux
[20/1/26, 19:02:03] Haziq KXHL: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23821717/
the brain is the seat of consciousness they said…
[20/1/26, 19:03:37] Haziq KXHL: meanwhile planaria get decapitated and are like yeah no problem i remember everything
[20/1/26, 19:03:59] ~ manav: Rn the vulgar neurotech view seems to be something like “if something feels continuous with your experiences it is basically you”
[20/1/26, 19:04:18] ~ manav: But idk whether this is particularly intuitive to me
[20/1/26, 19:06:17] ~ manav: Provided a promethean leap in tech it’s not altogether unrealistic for me to imagine my brain state and a good number of my memories existing in a different substrate contemporaneously with me. Will I feel a shared selfhood with this “mind”? ‎<This message was edited>
[20/1/26, 19:07:03] ~ manav: IMO most people will say no. So why is displacing it on the time series satisfying to whatever dissonance is there?
[20/1/26, 19:08:39] ~ manav: My point is that obviously there are loads of BS tech leaps with these sorts of startups but really they don’t get off the ground on a way more fundamental level
[20/1/26, 19:35:58] Haziq KXHL: bro just demonstrated the full extent of his him-ness rn. hope you don’t mind me translating for mere mortals bc i had to consult a thesaurus, stanford plato, encyclopaedia britannica, and my grandma’s cookbook to decode it 😭 (the cookbook cleared things up the most)
[20/1/26, 19:37:08] Haziq KXHL: basically he’s saying:
	•	before you talk about “saving yourself,” you need to explain what you even are
	•	tech people assume “if the next version remembers your life and thinks it’s you, then it counts”
	•	but that falls apart if there’s a second version of you walking around at the same time
	•	nobody actually thinks they now share one soul with their copy
	•	doing it slowly instead of all at once doesn’t fix that

tldr: you can’t dodge the “what is a person” question by upgrading yourself in installments
[20/1/26, 19:37:33] ~ manav: Much better put tbh
[20/1/26, 19:43:29] Haziq KXHL: but even our resident analytical philosophy professor is not ready for the inevitable rebuttal: “ok but Series A goes brrrr”
[20/1/26, 19:45:10] ~ manav: 😭😭😭 I feel the need to clarify that I have no formal training in philosophy just a hobbyist interest + I am especially poorly versed in analytic phil and think a lot of it is kinda fake apart from witt
[20/1/26, 19:45:27] ~ manav: But I appreciate the praise thank you 🙏🏽
[20/1/26, 19:52:12] Haziq KXHL: “i have no formal training and think most philosophy is fake” is literally how every eminent philosopher sounded right before becoming eminent 😆
[20/1/26, 20:34:25] ~ manav: Lol you’re too kind
[20/1/26, 23:16:31] Haziq KXHL: just learned that in māori culture they bury the baby’s placenta and plant a tree there. biggest FOMO of my life.

1. placenta already looks like a lil tree??? and literally keeps the baby alive so “tree of life” is not a metaphor it’s a resume
	2. then they plant an ACTUAL TREE on top of it hello???
3. placenta is basically the baby’s ride or die twin in so many cultures
	4. so now the twin LIVES ON AS A TREE??

why don’t _i_ have a twin tree. imagine going “no one understands me” and tree is like bestie i knew u before thoughts. robbed, frankly 😭🌳
[20/1/26, 23:22:04] Haziq KXHL: *idk if everyone feels robbed by this or if this is just what prolonged exposure to trophoblast research does to a person but mine could’ve been a tree and instead it was medical trash and that hurts 😖
[20/1/26, 23:37:24] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: I feel more robbed not owning bitcoin in 2017 soo
[20/1/26, 23:37:52] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Ps: crypto ship sailed prolly by 2017 too im kooky
[20/1/26, 23:38:10] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: *joking
[20/1/26, 23:42:31] Haziq KXHL: bitcoin cannot provide emotional support unless you count the white powder economy it enables
[20/1/26, 23:46:21] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Get a girl brooo
[20/1/26, 23:46:35] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: But then again idk be happy with yourself first I guess
[20/1/26, 23:47:01] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Actually omg this is the perfect group to ask this question
[20/1/26, 23:47:11] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: You all the smart people - how do you all cope?
[20/1/26, 23:48:01] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Like what’s your emotional support system? Personally I journal (a lot!), talk to mentors whenever I hit a roadblock, etc
[20/1/26, 23:48:13] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Just curious how you guys do it - send me a DM if you would like to
[20/1/26, 23:48:44] Haziq KXHL: ok but when a girl slaps you where do you go to process that? my tree wouldn’t hit me
[20/1/26, 23:49:17] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Depends on the context 😝
[20/1/26, 23:50:56] Haziq KXHL: sir. this is a group chat. risqué. pls stop
[21/1/26, 08:42:58] Haziq KXHL: not so gentle reminder that this gc has a _very_ low tolerance for innuendos and implicit references to explicit stuff
it’s not giving charisma, it’s giving secondhand embarrassment 
not asking anyone to follow victorian social norms, just keep it at Disney level pls
thanks
[21/1/26, 10:23:32] ~ samia 💗🌸: What with being chronically single ?
[21/1/26, 10:23:52] Haziq KXHL: another OOL problem from the trenches: one of the things i’m working on in liaison with rick prum (THE bird guy™️ 🦜) at yale is using quantitative genetics to show how some behavioural biases we associate with “morality” might emerge from mate choice (if ayer is smiling in his grave rn that’s none of my business). darwin famously said “the sight of a feather in a peacock’s tail makes me feel sick” and honestly same because coupling peacock feathers to survival values has become the biggest running joke in evo bio.

the standard story ppl tell is preference/trait runaway: females have a slight preference, males vary in the trait, the genes for the preference and the trait get correlated, boom feedback loop. mathematically this works great if both preference and trait are just numbers you can order on a single axis like “more tail” vs “less tail.” once that covariance is positive, the trait can get exaggerated even if it’s terrible for survival bc attraction is now doing the selecting.

the problem is that real ornaments are not 1 dimensional. peacock tails arn’t “tail but more” theyre insanely structured objects with symmetry, spatial patterning, colour physics etc 🦚 so for runaway to even start, development and perception already have to compress this huge high-dimensional space into a single evaluative axis  something like “ornament quality”. no explanation where that axis comes from or why it lines up with one verrrrrry specific template... teleology 🫠
[21/1/26, 10:23:54] ~ samia 💗🌸: You need to have a busier schedule and code more
[21/1/26, 10:24:09] Haziq KXHL: hey im tryna say something here 😑
[21/1/26, 10:24:24] ~ samia 💗🌸: Sorry I didn’t see you there 🫣
[21/1/26, 10:24:59] Haziq KXHL: let us know when they drop 25 hour days
[21/1/26, 10:25:26] ~ samia 💗🌸: If you convince yourself enough a 25 hour day exists , it will be come true
[21/1/26, 10:26:27] Haziq KXHL: good idea, lets gaslight the sun
[21/1/26, 10:33:54] Haziq KXHL: btw capitalism really won when y’all went “why don’t we create a hack club and generate economic value in our free time”
meanwhile my peacock feather mathematics remains proudly unmonetized
[21/1/26, 10:46:12] Haziq KXHL: i’ll have you know disney already ran that experiment: elsa, moana, mulan. results were positive
[21/1/26, 10:58:21] ~ samia 💗🌸: Exactly
[21/1/26, 11:14:49] Haziq KXHL: whereas anna rushed it and almost married a guy she met 20 minutes ago
ariel gave up her voice for a man (bad deal)
rapunzel dated the first criminal who showed up

disney raised me and honestly i’m grateful
[21/1/26, 11:16:44] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Isn’t it more like correlation doesn’t mean causation?
[21/1/26, 11:18:40] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: And I mean mate choice is a choice just like morality so? Spurious?
[21/1/26, 11:36:16] ~ Ekjot Singh: Hey, this is Ekjot. I just wanted to ask if you know any founders in SF area.
[21/1/26, 11:43:18] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Half of my LinkedIn in in YC25 😂
[21/1/26, 12:15:22] ~ Ada Ge: Friend wants some notes from UCL CS:
"I was hoping to get the slides /course material for this 1st yr: Introductory Mathematics for Computer Science and Discrete Mathematics for Computer Scientists.
2ndyr: Intermediate Mathematics for Computer Science"
[21/1/26, 12:16:28] ~ Ada Ge: Ivet @⁨Niv Ucl Builder⁩
[21/1/26, 12:16:46] ~ Ada Ge: can you solve this?
[21/1/26, 12:17:20] ~ Ada Ge: I would also like this please now I'm thinking about it
[21/1/26, 12:20:18] Niv Ucl Builder: yes, ill send these to her!
[21/1/26, 12:21:00] ~ Ada Ge: can you please also send this to me 🥺
[21/1/26, 12:21:14] Niv Ucl Builder: if someone finds out please let us know 😇
[21/1/26, 12:21:46] Niv Ucl Builder: okay!!! ill talk to the guys and do that after my lectures
[21/1/26, 12:22:12] Yi Hein:
[21/1/26, 12:22:17] Yi Hein: ‎You deleted this message.
[21/1/26, 12:22:56] Yi Hein: Hi everyone our next session is this Friday at 5.30pm at Kings Cross


Location: 5 Pancras Square
N1C 4AG
[21/1/26, 12:23:09] ‎You: ‎You pinned a message
[21/1/26, 12:23:41] Yi Hein: I’ll be building Wavenet for ECG generation
[21/1/26, 12:23:42] Niv Ucl Builder: also fristons giving a lecture on the 23rd for the phd students (on prediction errors and maybe basal ganglia stuff), feel free to sneak in. just dont tell them that i sent you. (dm for details) ‎<This message was edited>
[21/1/26, 12:25:01] Niv Ucl Builder: fire!!! have you managed to complete the gpt 2 series yet?
[21/1/26, 14:25:06] Haziq KXHL: it’s more like certain behaviours make mating systems stable or unstable
if a behaviour tends to break the system, populations where it spreads do worse
if a behaviour helps the system keep working, populations where it’s common do better

so the behaviour isn’t causing morality and morality isn’t causing mating
both are outcomes of the same underlying selection dynamics
[21/1/26, 14:28:01] Haziq KXHL: it’s also a nice example of orgel’s second law: evolution is cleverer than you are
ppl look at the average human tendency to be decent and go “that can’t be evolutionary. exploiting others would increase fitness”
and the models are like bestie don’t tell me what i can or cannot do

once you actually look at system level dynamics, it turns out exploitative strategies are locally tempting but globally self defeating
[21/1/26, 14:33:13] Haziq KXHL: caveat: this technically falls out of the lande-kirkpatrick mate choice model which is “canonical” in the same way a broken ikea chair is canonical

also even if evolution gives you a behavioural bias that still doesn’t answer the actual annoying human question of “ok but why should i not do X when i am fully capable of overriding that bias”

and when ppl respond with “idk just because it feels wrong” congrats, you’ve rediscovered A J Ayer’s moral emotivism
[21/1/26, 14:45:49] Haziq KXHL: @⁨Niv Ucl Builder⁩ since you make apps i’m assigning you the gen z mutual ghosting equilibrium

features i expect in v1:
* onboarding quiz that distinguishes “emotionally unavailable” from “just tired”
* toggle for “i want love” vs “i just want someone to parallel exist with”
* auto schedules the date so no one has to say “so when are you free”
* live translator for subtext (“lol” -> “i am anxious but interested”)
* emergency button that sends “hey sorry i got overwhelmed but i do like you”

if this works you save a generation. either way pls ship by end of quarter 😇
[21/1/26, 14:47:27] ~ Ada Ge: call me stupid but why is it difficult to find a partner? just be attractive and flirt with people?
[21/1/26, 14:47:36] Haziq KXHL: we could even give it a sick name like “Apprentice Living”… oh nvm @⁨~Elma ⁩ beat us to it 😭
[21/1/26, 14:48:58] Haziq KXHL: you’ve just named the two things gen z is statistically least equipped to do
[21/1/26, 14:49:34] ~ Elma : ide like it anymore and I trademarked it for hundreds 😔
[21/1/26, 14:52:39] Haziq KXHL: yeah ngl apprentice living sounds like a channel 4 documentary from 2008
i would’ve called it something like _get in da house_
[21/1/26, 14:53:09] ~ Elma : I’m telling yi hien u said that
[21/1/26, 14:53:14] ~ Elma : #yellowcard
[21/1/26, 14:54:12] Haziq KXHL: refs are wild this season 😖
[21/1/26, 14:54:49] ~ Elma : Probs cos the players are shit
[21/1/26, 14:54:54] Haziq KXHL: i bow to no man… except the bossman 😶
[21/1/26, 14:57:36] Haziq KXHL: they’re not playing the system properly, too much space between the lines
[21/1/26, 14:58:01] Haziq KXHL: (i’ve never watched football i just know how ppl talk 🤥)
[21/1/26, 16:25:18] Haziq KXHL: i don’t have much life experience but i got some pretty solid math on this. want it or nah?
(zero evolutionary biology, pure differential equations)
[21/1/26, 16:34:08] ~ Ada Ge: Yes please
[21/1/26, 16:45:48] Haziq KXHL: ……ok
[21/1/26, 16:50:31] Haziq KXHL:

[21/1/26, 16:51:42] Haziq KXHL: istg i have a point. pls wait for context
[21/1/26, 16:54:05] Haziq KXHL: so I acc asked my differential equations professor this pre festive season like “how come every age group is thriving except ours” and she took it way too seriously and goes “ok so how does your generation usually react in these situations?” ‎<This message was edited>
[21/1/26, 16:55:38] Haziq KXHL: and I’m like: we self-reject, panic, run, hide, relocate internationally. *fyi* : it’s called a fearful-avoidant attachment style, tl;dr you got betrayed hard as a toddler (in my case my 5-year-old sister gaslit me into believing I was found in a trash can)
[21/1/26, 16:56:09] Haziq KXHL: she nods, thinks for a second and goes
“yeah the eigenvalue is 2. that’s why y'all don’t text back”
[21/1/26, 16:56:13] ~ Alex Pylypenko: bruh
[21/1/26, 16:58:36] ~ samia 💗🌸: Guys come on now
[21/1/26, 16:59:00] ~ samia 💗🌸: Calling it a matchmaking business is a) not true and b) undermines all her hard work
[21/1/26, 17:02:48] Haziq KXHL: oh my bad, thought we’d buried the hatchet 😭
just a joke about the name being taken
[21/1/26, 17:03:54] Haziq KXHL: also she’s our friend too, might even like us more than u idk
[21/1/26, 17:04:17] ~ samia 💗🌸: Hahahah as if 😉 ‎<This message was edited>
[21/1/26, 17:04:24] ~ samia 💗🌸: Hmmmm
[21/1/26, 17:05:49] ~ Elma : Hey weve already resolved this everything’s all good
[21/1/26, 17:06:54] ~ Elma : Hey I like everyone and I’ve known samia for timee
[21/1/26, 17:07:06] Haziq KXHL: i genuinely can’t tell if that hmmmm is reassuring or threatening
[21/1/26, 17:16:04] Haziq KXHL: some of us just have a sweet disposition and are naturally likeable (me)
others you grow into. slowly.
[21/1/26, 17:16:13] Haziq KXHL: anyway ok let me get back to my math
[21/1/26, 17:16:41] ~ samia 💗🌸: Ok lol
[21/1/26, 17:16:50] ~ samia 💗🌸: Maybe I took girls supporting girls too far
[21/1/26, 17:17:06] ~ samia 💗🌸: It’s all love lol
[21/1/26, 17:19:51] Haziq KXHL: ok so same romeo & juliet setup

R = how much romeo likes juliet
J = how much juliet likes romeo

and the cursed rule is basically:
the moment one of them likes the other more, their brain goes “oh no ❤️❌” ‎<This message was edited>
[21/1/26, 17:20:36] ~ samia 💗🌸: I think we need to run a deep detailed science experiment on dating
[21/1/26, 17:20:58] ~ samia 💗🌸: Relying on ourselves and our emotional intelligence is not proving good
[21/1/26, 17:21:04] ~ samia 💗🌸: And learn based off the results
[21/1/26, 17:21:16] Haziq KXHL: if R ≈ J
* everything is chill
* mutual interest
* normal texting
* no one overanalyzes punctuation

but if R > J even a little
romeo goes:
* “why do i care this much”

[21/1/26, 17:21:35] Haziq KXHL: so instead of moving toward each other, they both start running in opposite directions
not because they don’t like each other
but because they like each other too asymmetrically

fearful avoidant brain logic:
closeness = danger
distance = control

so @⁨~Ada Ge⁩ “just flirt and be attractive” assumes
liking someone doesn’t trigger your fight-or-flight response

which… lol

[21/1/26, 20:29:34] Haziq KXHL: i’ve contributed to solving this as much as any good chaos theorist can
what’s your contribution as a consultant?
any solutions involving “alignment” or “circle back”?

[22/1/26, 08:09:52] Hera KXHL: ooh looks interesting
[22/1/26, 08:15:22] Haziq KXHL: awesome I’ve added you to the 18 hour study roster ☠️
[22/1/26, 08:34:32] ~ Kevin: lol hello apologies for intruding - manav invited to the chat, and I couldn’t but notice a convo on math and relationships…

https://open.substack.com/pub/acotra/p/the-stable-marriage-problem?r=obshg&utm_medium=ios&shareImageVariant=overlay

tldr:
- relationship-pairing is formalised via the stable matching problem 
- ⁠gale-shapeley algo is optimal
- ⁠the “personal” takeaway is to just do things… high agency ppl get rewarded vs low agency get punished
enjoy :)
[22/1/26, 08:49:44] Haziq KXHL: as a “woke feminist lib” in the author’s words, I don’t rate this highly 🙂‍↔️
[22/1/26, 09:26:09] ~ Kevin: it is an unfortunate “reality” if u agree with its premise
[22/1/26, 09:55:46] Haziq KXHL: this is emotionally repressed tech bro math

yes gale shapley is real. but using it as dating advice only works if you assume rejection is free (nobody has trauma etc.) aka fake humans

also the sigma move of treating outcomes as pure agency is grotesque. ppl don’t self-reject because they’re passive, they self-reject because closeness feels unsafe

anyway if dating worked like gale-shapley, therapy wouldn’t exist and none of us would be in this group chat
[22/1/26, 09:57:53] Haziq KXHL: anything is an unfortunate reality if you accept a dumb enough premise.
gödel proved god with math. see you at sunday mass
[22/1/26, 10:01:34] ~ manav: Is it heretical to say on this gc that I don’t think maths is a particularly useful way of approaching this problem
[22/1/26, 10:04:37] ~ manav: Am I allowed to give some boomer uncle advice? I will try to use maths speak to better proselytise to you guys. I think 2 important things are true. Firstly that gendered bimodality in humans is a heavily overlapping distribution. Most people are way more similar than they are different. For any gendered trait there will be a large contingent of the opposite gender who display it to an equal or greater extent. You only really see heavy bimodality at the tails of both distributions. I don’t have any data for any of this it is just intuitively true to me from my experience of the world
[22/1/26, 10:04:47] Haziq KXHL: _gasps theatrically_
every problem is a math problem imo. skill issue if you’re doing math and getting tech bro conclusions.

if you model reality correctly you always end up with a woke lib answer.  as stephen colbert famously said, _reality has a liberal bias_ 

bad math gives sigma takes. good math gives “huh maybe humans have feelings”
[22/1/26, 10:06:39] Haziq KXHL: ⭐ shamelessly doing woke lib feminist dialectics ⭐
this is my one ideological hobby, let me have it
[22/1/26, 10:07:56] ~ manav: This means if you are choosing some kind of redpilled optimisation strategy based on polarisation, you are selecting for the tail end of the distribution. And this is bad because it’s not the tail end in a good way, e.g. most men and women are similarly assertive but most people in prison for violent crime are men. This is the kind of “tail end” we are talking about here
[22/1/26, 10:09:43] ~ manav: The cohort is all important. When you reduce preference to any kind of bimodality or gendered thing you are making a really undesirable world for yourself, because you are now traversing a cohort that is going to confirm your most rancid and bleak views of gender dynamics
[22/1/26, 10:12:07] ~ manav: To put it more simply if your mental model of mate selection is that “people have zero higher order thinking and in reality we are governed by inscrutable animal base impulses” the only place this worldview will yield success is amongst people who actually are, for whatever traumatic reasons, governed by base impulse
[22/1/26, 10:13:05] Haziq KXHL: i rate this, altho it’s giving a bit of Friston “your model creates the reality you experience” vibes lol
[22/1/26, 10:13:57] ~ manav: What does this mean in practice? Just that provided you are a fundamentally decent and socially competent person, you need to just find spaces where the things you like about yourself are liked by other people also
[22/1/26, 10:14:35] ~ manav: I feel many dating problems of our generation decompose to other way more boring problems. Lack of third spaces, lower social engagement, etc
[22/1/26, 10:14:53] ~ manav: The serendipity surface has reduced massively for our gen ‎<This message was edited>
[22/1/26, 10:18:44] ~ manav: It’s way simpler than that tho. Your strategy determines your approach completely. The stupidest thing in the world is ppl who employ the “opportunistically pick up drunk people at the club for a one night stand” strategy and then lament that nobody wants long term relationships anymore or whatever
[22/1/26, 10:19:19] ~ manav: Coming out in favour of Just Being Normal
[22/1/26, 10:20:20] Haziq KXHL: hard agree on the boring structural causes, but i also think ppl treating dating like a game theory spreadsheet instead of vibes + chemistry is actively making things worse (this may be biased because i score terribly on spreadsheets and excellently on vibes)
[22/1/26, 10:21:30] ~ manav: So I don’t think maths is incapable of modelling these things well. I just think that wanting companionship lies pretty close to the core of our being and modelling lacks the pathos to deal with it. What happened to, like, poetry
[22/1/26, 10:21:53] ~ manav: Bro that’s kind of the point I’m making
[22/1/26, 10:23:05] Haziq KXHL: i kinda sympathise with the nightclub types tbh 😭
that’s like one of the only places left where you can escape optimization brain. everywhere else it’s “but will this work long term” math so hard that nothing ever actually happens

(this is being said with 0 clubbing experience, no intention to club, and a firm policy of not being within 10ft of alcohol)
[22/1/26, 10:23:34] ~ manav: There is nothing wrong with going to the club and getting drunk and finding someone there
[22/1/26, 10:23:46] ~ manav: I am not a scold lmao
[22/1/26, 10:24:39] ~ manav: I’m saying that it should be enjoyed for what it is
[22/1/26, 10:24:53] ~ manav: Why do that and then write substacks about how long term relationships are dead
[22/1/26, 10:25:27] ~ manav: Go to a book club about a genre you find interesting and you will soon discover that long term relationships are alive
[22/1/26, 10:26:56] ~ manav: I think what we can do actual substack discourse about is dating apps
[22/1/26, 10:27:09] Haziq KXHL: maybe even long term relationships should be allowed to be a little more whimsical and nightclub-coded. less “five year plan feasibility analysis,” more “this feels good lets see”
[22/1/26, 10:27:48] ~ manav: 100% cool with this so long as it doesn’t turn you into an Andrew Tate guy upon failure
[22/1/26, 10:28:20] Haziq KXHL: go to a book club about postmodern literary criticism and watch everyone stay single on principle
[22/1/26, 10:28:30] ~ manav: Notice the lack of expectations in option 2
[22/1/26, 10:28:55] ~ manav: Total ban on bringing expectations into the club. What happens happens
[22/1/26, 10:29:59] ~ manav: Snatching failure from the jaws of success
[22/1/26, 10:30:38] ~ manav: Ok gtg. Sorry for boomer dating rant
[22/1/26, 10:32:49] Haziq KXHL: nah this wasn’t boomer dating, boomer dating is “i married the girl next door because our parents carpooled”
[22/1/26, 10:41:16] Haziq KXHL: maybe expectations shouldn’t be none, just different. like idk… emotional availability, James Dean energy, eye contact. tl;dr chemistry.
instead of a finance résumé and linkedin filters.

this might be my disney indoctrination speaking but Rapunzel fell for a literal criminal and i rate it highly because they had chemistry. Aladdin and Jasmine would never have happened if jasmine paused to evaluate his long term earning potential or how she’d introduce him to her parents 😵‍💫
‎[22/1/26, 10:56:47] Haziq KXHL: i actually love poetry 😭 here’s one. it’s kinda niche. i found it in this deissroth book which may or may not make it less romantic, unclear... (fyi he's the legendary psychiatrist who invented optogenetics for y'all in the doctor to scientist pipeline)

i loved it so much i swore i’d only ever share it with one person (yet to be found). the fact that i’m instead posting it in a group chat is a statistically accurate summary of the tragic state of my life ‎image omitted
[22/1/26, 10:57:29] ~ Suhas: If you read further you will see the author self identifies as a woke feminist lib
[22/1/26, 10:58:01] Haziq KXHL: @⁨Niv Ucl Builder⁩ Borges btw, your favourite author
[22/1/26, 10:59:46] Haziq KXHL: the vibes were “i am immune because i said the words”
[22/1/26, 11:01:02] ~ manav: Why are psychiatrists so overrepresented in terms of clinician-scientist achievements
[22/1/26, 11:01:27] ~ manav: Should I be pursuing psych training instead of neurology to do good behavioural neuro research??
[22/1/26, 11:01:40] Haziq KXHL: bc their day job is fake so they have insane free time
[22/1/26, 11:02:38] ~ manav: Yeah I’ve also noticed that their research has very limited continuity with their clinical careers lol
[22/1/26, 11:02:43] ~ Alex Pylypenko: ?????????????????
[22/1/26, 11:03:18] ~ manav: Don’t take the bait brother
[22/1/26, 11:05:09] ~ manav: 1 hour of intense dialectical argument later: yes, psychiatrists are necessary in this fallen world we inhabit but it’s just paper over the structural conditions that often contribute to acute mental illness blah blah blah
[22/1/26, 11:05:47] ~ Alex Pylypenko: nah sometimes i just don't know whether haziq is serious or joking or ragebaiting or what....
[22/1/26, 11:06:54] Haziq KXHL: no ok i’ll concede 😭 psychiatry is obviously useful. talking to patients, triage, meds sometimes help. we do in fact need them.

i just don’t buy the high horse over clinical psychologists. the main difference is psychiatrists get to prescribe drugs based on vibes.

also pls look up the DSM-5 reproducibility crisis. the empirics are about on par with my grandma’s folk medicine
[22/1/26, 11:08:40] ~ manav: @⁨~Kevin⁩ thoughts?
[22/1/26, 11:09:50] Haziq KXHL: bro went full Doctor Strange, saw 14 million futures and somehow predicted my exact reaction
[22/1/26, 11:10:06] ~ manav: I actually agree w you without caveat on this
[22/1/26, 11:10:24] ~ manav: I came to med school to do psychiatry but was disillusioned by this fact mostly
[22/1/26, 11:10:59] ~ manav: Still trying to figure out whether some version of the profession is salvageable
[22/1/26, 11:12:04] ~ manav: But struggling to see beyond the fact that any given psychiatric condition is either a neurological disorder with unknown biological basis or better handled via a formulation approach by a well trained psychotherapist
[22/1/26, 11:12:51] Haziq KXHL: who me? this is slander, i am a model of calm earnest discourse. i have never once joked or exaggerated in my life 🤥
[22/1/26, 11:13:39] ~ manav: There are a few cases where I think it’s defensible. Firstly meds can be useful in stabilising acute crisis. But they sometimes also induce acute crisis, so it’s a bit of a wash
[22/1/26, 11:13:48] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Or if I’m talking to a GPT
[22/1/26, 11:14:07] ~ Alex Pylypenko: nah he's too intelligent to be an openai model
[22/1/26, 11:14:16] ~ Alex Pylypenko: claude, sure
[22/1/26, 11:15:39] Haziq KXHL: i dont even use that much water tho 😕
[22/1/26, 11:16:10] ~ manav: Secondly there’s a transitional role. Lots of neurodegenerative diseases etc have psychological implications and there’s a case for having strong medical training in these situations
[22/1/26, 11:17:01] ~ manav: Thirdly and most dubiously there might be situations in which a psychological problem that is in principle treatable with psychotherapy etc are better treated by a drug
[22/1/26, 11:20:25] ~ manav: Frankly my biggest blackpill was going to queen’s square neuro grand round and seeing cases where meme psych diagnoses were given to patients who later ended up in neuro and turned out to have some exotic encephalitis
[22/1/26, 11:24:38] Haziq KXHL: ngl i chickened out of medicine purely because i have a severe aversion to blood 😭
my personal compromise is clinical psychology because i genuinely love talking to people f2f and making someone feel better feels more meaningful to me than most intellectual feats.

but i also wanna do mechanistic research because i refuse to be a witch doctor. Katarina Schmack @ crick is my hero. computational neuro + neuro-immune biology to  understand psychosis 🔥
[22/1/26, 11:25:05] ~ Kevin: damn its hard to keep up with this chat lol - for a quick defence of the stuff before this: im of the same mindset as u that math is silly used in these higher order systems, and often seemingly used as a justification for an inherently held cultural view.

per the crises of psychiatry: 
- the high horse is simply a historical remnant, where the label of psychiatry/neurology are the forefathers of our modern conception of mental health professionals. Freud was  an Austrian neurologist, Kraeplin was a german psychiatrist. Of course, modern paradigms of Beck etc are what we use today, but you don’t have Beck without Freud mass popularising psychology as a field
- ⁠when you talk to any psychiatrist (at least my ultimate observations in aus), they all see the limitations and understand the critiques of the DSM. there is no debate here the empirics are flawed, but these are also a historical remnant. the first pseudo diagnostic system from kraeplin, then the post WWII “medical 203” manual are its origins - in a time where we just called everyone loony, we needed some classification to make progress in research. The issue is that its stayed too long, gained undeserved authority, and entrenched through pharma/regulatory/power incentives. I assume awareness of HiTOP/RDoC as attempts to remedy this, but we need a new paradigm inversion
[22/1/26, 11:25:48] ~ Kevin: also see: https://asteriskmag.com/issues/12-books/you-arent-in-the-dsm for an excellent historical/critical recount
[22/1/26, 11:27:49] ~ manav: I’m on board w all of this. Psychiatry indeed is better than what came before
[22/1/26, 11:27:56] ~ manav: But what’s the positive future facing vision
[22/1/26, 11:28:42] ~ manav: If DSM-type classification is pretty defunct, if the historical elevation of psychiatrists over other MHPs is also defunct, what’s left
[22/1/26, 11:28:52] ~ manav: Also shoutout to this guy: https://markhorowitz.org/
[22/1/26, 11:29:23] ~ manav: UCL MBPhD psychiatrist whose entire quest in life is safe deprescribing
[22/1/26, 11:29:41] ~ manav: He’s basically ‘solved’ antidepressant tapering and is on antipsychotics now
[22/1/26, 11:30:23] ~ manav: Joanna Montcrieff acolyte, see here for her work https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-022-01661-0
[22/1/26, 11:30:24] Haziq KXHL: i mean that’s kind of our collective project in this GC right 😭
we’re all in computational neuro specifically to give this field some empirical teeth
[22/1/26, 11:31:02] ~ manav: Reminds me of Seriès’ intro in Computational Psychiatry
[22/1/26, 11:31:07] ~ manav: It’s acc very moving let me find it
[22/1/26, 11:31:27] ~ Kevin: an aussie wooo
‎[22/1/26, 11:31:55] ~ manav: ‎image omitted
[22/1/26, 11:32:03] ~ Kevin: have indeed come across his work - and one led to a ridiculous stat that 1 in 5 australians are on antidepressants… actually nuts
[22/1/26, 11:34:05] ~ manav: I want to believe. But you know my problems w this approach
[22/1/26, 11:34:53] ~ Kevin: the dream indeed.

the thing im curious about in a sort of “progress studies of psychiatry” is how we then translate the empirics to clinical, sociocultural, societal approaches

and also if we need more paradigm inversions to truly make progress on empirics a la @⁨~manav⁩
[22/1/26, 11:35:46] ~ manav: Like how is this different to previous metaphors? The ‘pneumatic theory of the brain’ gave rise to the pneumatic theory of mental illness
[22/1/26, 11:36:51] Haziq KXHL: valid. i’m just hoping we can do this pragmatically without trying to quin qualia
[22/1/26, 11:36:59] ~ manav: Maybe it’s just another useful metaphor. But I want more from this right? Let us not just collapse into empty perspectivism
[22/1/26, 11:37:20] ~ manav: There are genuinely psychiatrists out there today who defend serotonin theory of depression for its ‘didactic and narrative value'
[22/1/26, 11:37:51] ~ manav: This is the bad ending. We will talk about circuit neuroscience as a nice story to help psychotherapy take hold
[22/1/26, 11:38:38] ~ manav: Already this is everywhere. “Dopamine fasting” “dopamine detox” etc
[22/1/26, 11:39:43] Haziq KXHL: honestly that’s exactly my issue with a lot of computational neuroscience. so much of it rests on the biological neuron = perceptron equivalence, which i think is just straight up idiotic and massively metaphorical
[22/1/26, 11:39:57] ~ manav: So what’s the goal? Circuit level accounts of mental illnesses yield what exactly
[22/1/26, 11:40:12] ~ manav: Is the purpose to produce better therapeutics
[22/1/26, 11:40:54] Haziq KXHL: that’s why i’m very anti top-down theorizing here. i want bottom-up empiricism all the way down. i buy the neural manifold view. less “this neuron computes x,” more “what geometry does the population activity actually live in”
[22/1/26, 11:42:57] Haziq KXHL: step 1: map the neural manifolds underlying behaviour
step 2: see how those geometries get warped in pathology
step 3: design interventions that restore “normal” geometry

ideally via closed-loop BCIs that can sense the state, compute what’s off, and actively apply the right topological transformation
[22/1/26, 11:43:29] ~ manav: If this is the case then things only get better when we shed the yoke of psychiatry. My friend started off doing a schizophrenia genomics PhD, totally lost in the sauce. Now it’s more like “we have identified a rare coding variant which corresponds to a really specific symptom cluster. It’s to do with [redacted] trafficking in neurons. Thus far we have lumped it in with schizophrenia but it might be something else entirely that’s tractable with a one-shot therapeutic”
[22/1/26, 11:43:33] ~ manav: The opposite of meme
[22/1/26, 11:44:24] ~ manav: The best thing you can do in psychiatry is rescue a population of patients from the categorical terrorism of psychiatry
[22/1/26, 11:45:09] ~ manav: I’m being dramatic and obviously it’s not malevolent categorisation, it’s best we can do in a bad situation categorisation
[22/1/26, 11:45:26] ~ manav: But it’s still like surgery pre handwashing
[22/1/26, 11:46:34] ~ manav: Conversely the worst thing you can do in psychiatry is reify a totally heuristic diagnostic category with spurious genetic biomarkers
[22/1/26, 11:50:10] ~ manav: The smartest response to this would be that all diagnostic categories, even those of non-mental ailments, are heuristic. Then it’s a matter of specificity. I am inclined to believe that hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia is indeed actually just one condition caused by a specific set of mutations. Do we really believe that ‘schizophrenia’ is one thing with one genetic basis? I know people don’t argue this but biomarker research acts like this is the case sometimes
[22/1/26, 11:51:35] ~ manav: It’s also about telos. *Everyone* in non-psych medicine wants to atomise conditions. I want to know the precise causes that underpin a myocardial infarction, I am not contented to let “MI” hang as a “perspective” into the “internality” of a heart attack
[22/1/26, 11:52:24] ~ manav: Insofar as computational psychiatry will be a useful paradigm it will encourage a similar sentiment. We should all be utterly discontented with our diagnostic categories and seek to reduce them maximally
[22/1/26, 12:43:06] ~ Kevin: your argument sounds very szaszian mr ponnekanti :)
[22/1/26, 12:45:54] ~ manav: Szasz is certainly _an_ influence on me but I think it’s basically word games whether greater diagnostic specificity is dismantling psychiatry or fixing it from within
[22/1/26, 13:22:00] Haziq KXHL: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40911433
denis noble rates your take highly
[22/1/26, 13:25:55] Haziq KXHL: that’s basically why we left genomics for systems biology.

systems approaches at least let you say “ok, this is a family of dynamical failures” rather than “surely there is One Gene To Rule Them All” less category worship, more mechanism, more interaction, more state dependence
[22/1/26, 13:30:44] Haziq KXHL: i agree on atomisation, but the atoms have to be real. bottom up atoms, not explanatory ones we invented

you take actual biological variables, look at their permutations, cluster those and then see what categories fall out. youll find something like “schizophrenia” isn’t one thing but sits between multiple real clusters
[22/1/26, 13:51:38] Haziq KXHL: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00088-1
also worth flagging: we can’t get dogmatic about our “atoms” either

like the day we realised there’s no bijection between cell's transcriptome (gene expression profile) and phenotype was a dark day for us transcriptomics ppl
[22/1/26, 13:55:19] Haziq KXHL: ok but i’m actually obsessed w this poem

it took me quite some time, a bit of soul searching and more than one poetry interpretation class to get what borges was saying

if there is demand i can produce a gen z / hack club coded reading

just don’t mind the freudian slips
[22/1/26, 13:55:32] ~ Ada Ge: i would like a reading
[22/1/26, 13:57:04] Haziq KXHL: stand by. i must first re enter the psychic damage zone and then i’ll drop a reading asap
[22/1/26, 16:42:12] Haziq KXHL: breaking: @⁨~manav⁩ is real and walks among us
lollll finally bumped into him randomly in bloomsbury
[22/1/26, 16:42:31] ~ manav: Was a privilege to run into you sir
[22/1/26, 16:54:30] Haziq KXHL: ok i’ve been thinking a lot about how to frame this reading and i think the only way it works is as a story

modern gen z tech-adjacent

starring our beloved recurring characters: *Alex and Taylor* (shout out to @⁨Hera KXHL⁩)

bring s’mores 🍫🔥
[22/1/26, 17:07:49] Haziq KXHL: alex is a hyper competent tech guy who turned down multiple six figure FAANG offers and at least one co-founder invite so he could maintain an open-source functional programming language with ~12 users (not incriminating anyone)

taylor is a FAANG engineer on the corporate grind. ships features, gets promoted, has strong opinions about 401ks
[22/1/26, 17:08:12] ~ Alex Pylypenko: are you _sure_ you're not incriminating anyone
[22/1/26, 17:09:02] Haziq KXHL: alex is a literary device, pls do not self report
[22/1/26, 17:09:26] Haziq KXHL: ok now onto the poem
[22/1/26, 17:11:50] Haziq KXHL: 1/ "The useless dawn finds me in a deserted street-corner;
I have outlived the night."

alex stayed up coding all night like that would fix him
it did not
[22/1/26, 17:13:08] Haziq KXHL: 2/ "Nights are proud waves; darkblue topheavy waves
laden with all the hues of deep spoil, laden with
things unlikely and desirable."

night is when crazy, interesting, emotionally charged stuff is supposed to happen

for alex this mostly means bug fixes
[22/1/26, 17:14:33] Haziq KXHL: 3/ "Nights have a habit of mysterious gifts and refusals,
of things half given away, half withheld,
of joys with a dark hemisphere. Nights act
that way, I tell you."

night gives alex just enough to keep him delusional
but never enough to actually change his life
[22/1/26, 17:18:22] Haziq KXHL: 4/ "The surge, that night, left me the customary shreds
and odd ends: some hated friends to chat
with, music for dreams, and the smoking of
bitter ashes. The things my hungry heart
has no use for."

alex keeps thinking hackathons and hack clubs will fill the void
idiot has confused intellectual stimulation with intimacy
‎[22/1/26, 17:21:38] ~ Alex Pylypenko: ‎GIF omitted
[22/1/26, 17:22:02] Haziq KXHL: bro im tryna say something here
[22/1/26, 17:22:48] ~ Euan Ong: samsara, i tell you
[22/1/26, 17:23:26] Haziq KXHL: ok shall we proceed?
[22/1/26, 17:24:46] Haziq KXHL: this is a historic moment. no one has ever done a gen z reading of borges. please do not distract me
[22/1/26, 17:26:20] Haziq KXHL: 5/ "The big wave brought you.
Words, any words, your laughter; and you so lazily
and incessantly beautiful. We talked and you
have forgotten the words."

and then taylor randomly shows up to one of these events
which is insane because she has an actual life, better things to do etc.
alex hears her laugh and suddenly open source is no longer enough
[22/1/26, 17:30:20] Haziq KXHL: 6/ "The shattering dawn finds me in a deserted street
of my city.
Your profile turned away, the sounds that go to
make your name, the lilt of your laughter:
these are the illustrious toys you have left me."

taylor leaves and does not come back cos as previously mentioned she has better things to do than hang out with hack club low lifes
alex is now replaying every micro detail

meanwhile taylor is like "wait which alex?"
[22/1/26, 17:31:40] Haziq KXHL: 7/ "I turn them over in the dawn, I lose them, I find
them; I tell them to the few stray dogs and
to the few stray stars of the dawn."

ibid. guy has gone delulu
[22/1/26, 17:33:39] Haziq KXHL: 8/ "Your dark rich life …
I must get at you, somehow; I put away those
illustrious toys you have left me, I want your
hidden look, your real smile -- that lonely,
mocking smile your cool mirror knows."

alex bro i’m warning you
whatever you do next
do not become a freakin stalker
you are already embarrassing as is
[22/1/26, 17:36:21] Haziq KXHL: ok tbf
taylor’s been on the corporate grind
she’s in FAANG mode, posturing a little like we all do

alex is basically saying he wants to know her with the guard down
[22/1/26, 17:36:58] ~ Ada Ge: wait. this is beautiful
[22/1/26, 17:41:19] Haziq KXHL: 9/ "What can I hold you with?
I offer you lean streets, desperate sunsets, the
moon of the jagged suburbs."

alex is doing the math and realizing
omg… i actually have nothing to offer this girl

alex is broke. taylor is well off.
alex has no social mileage. taylor has it in spades
[22/1/26, 17:43:40] Haziq KXHL: so he’s like ok i have… sunsets

but then like doesn’t everyone have sunsets?

but also maybe she’s been so busy grinding that no one ever bothered to show her one
because corporate "friendships" are built on mutual extraction anyway
[22/1/26, 17:44:33] Haziq KXHL: 10/ "I offer you the bitterness of a man who has looked
long and long at the lonely moon."

alex is trying to convert loneliness into romantic credit
[22/1/26, 17:52:02] Haziq KXHL: 11 / "I offer you my ancestors, my dead men, the ghosts
that living men have honoured in bronze:
my father’s father killed in the frontier of
Buenos Aires, two bullets through his lungs,
bearded and dead, wrapped by his soldiers in
the hide of a cow; my mother’s grandfather
-- just twenty-four -- heading a charge of
three hundred men in Peru, now ghosts on
vanished horses."

alex is basically like ok but i have deep lore
like the time he almost made IOI camp 👀

compare that to taylor’s usual npc friends who are like school -> uni -> job
and you’re bored two minutes in
[22/1/26, 17:54:23] Haziq KXHL: 12/ "I offer you whatever insight my books may hold,
whatever manliness or humour my life.
I offer you the loyalty of a man who has never
been loyal."

alex: i’m smart and interesting
also i’ve never been loyal bcos no one’s ever let me be
[22/1/26, 17:55:50] Haziq KXHL: 13/ "I offer you that kernel of myself that I have saved,
somehow -- the central heart that deals not
in words, traffics not with dreams, and is
untouched by time, by joy, by adversities."

alex: i have a heart
evidence: beta blockers
[22/1/26, 17:57:45] Haziq KXHL: but fr hes talking abt the bit of him that still wants something simple and stupid and human
like the part he hasn’t turned into a project or a repo
[22/1/26, 17:59:52] Haziq KXHL: 14/ "I offer you the memory of a yellow rose seen at
sunset, years before you were born."

alex is like ok btw i also appreciate beauty
and you’re the only person i want to share that with

alex is trying to be romantic
instead he reveals the age gap 🤦‍♂️
[22/1/26, 18:01:24] Haziq KXHL: 15/ "I offer you explanations of yourself, theories about
yourself, authentic and surprising news of
yourself."

alex is like i’ll pay attention to you in a way your corporate environment never did
you didn’t even know you were this interesting
[22/1/26, 18:06:14] Haziq KXHL: 16/ "I can give you my loneliness, my darkness, the
hunger of my heart; I am trying to bribe you
with uncertainty, with danger, with defeat."

alex is like ok i can’t offer stability or a normal future
but like maybe stability is overrated anyway??
i mean have you met corporate FAANG big tech ppl. kinda NPC ‎<This message was edited>
[22/1/26, 18:08:34] Haziq KXHL: anyway that’s the reading folks. translation live up to the hype?
scale of 1-10 how cheesy is it
[22/1/26, 18:19:59] ~ Alex Pylypenko: i rate it 67/10
[22/1/26, 21:33:17] Haziq KXHL: ill take 6.7 but whats the axis? literary brilliance, romance quotient or raw cheese density?
[22/1/26, 21:38:43] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Whoever Alex is bro is so spoiled with attention
[22/1/26, 21:38:59] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: I don’t think any person bro dates will even come close
[22/1/26, 21:39:05] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: You ruined romance for them 😂
[22/1/26, 21:39:22] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Ex axis 🤣 ‎<This message was edited>
‎[22/1/26, 22:00:50] Haziq KXHL: @⁨~Laith⁩ @⁨~manav⁩ you two are up next 🔥 ‎image omitted
[22/1/26, 22:03:05] ~ manav: Lmao I think they discontinued this
[22/1/26, 22:18:18] Haziq KXHL: i also have a cinderella retelling where she’s a phd student with an evil supervisor who won’t let her go to conferences until one day she does and leaves her research poster behind… will share eventually down the line 😆
‎[22/1/26, 22:20:35] Haziq KXHL: for the humanities ppl: jorge luis borges and also me unfortunately (bc I grew up reading corny trash like abv) are very much influenced by the “romanticism” lineage of continental philosophy. heart over mind, love is inherently irrational etc ‎image omitted
[23/1/26, 09:43:14] Niv Ucl Builder: https://gptzero.me/news/neurips/
[23/1/26, 09:46:17] Niv Ucl Builder: i dont think its fair to put borges under that camp!!! borges certainly did not view love as an ideal but as an obsession (see The Zahir: https://web.mit.edu/allanmc/www/borgeszahir.pdf) ‎<This message was edited>
[23/1/26, 09:49:46] Niv Ucl Builder: really cool work on hallucinated citations in this year's Neurips batch
[23/1/26, 10:15:42] ~ samia 💗🌸: I actually use gpt zero to look for hallucinations in my work/references
[23/1/26, 10:20:03] ~ samia 💗🌸: I’m not sure how to articulate this correctly but most of my citations were marked as hallucinations . But not because they were AI-generated, but because I placed my references after my analysis instead of directly following the specific statistic /statement I sourced from a website
[23/1/26, 10:20:42] ~ samia 💗🌸: Obviously I made the edits I needed to , maybe I’m outting myself as not knowing how to reference properly 😭🙏🏼
[23/1/26, 10:27:39] Niv Ucl Builder: I am not too sure with how GPTZero's hallucination checker works, I have never used it.
[23/1/26, 10:28:43] Niv Ucl Builder: i think the ones in this article are quite obviously false since the title and authors just do not match any indexed papers
[23/1/26, 11:54:27] ~ samia 💗🌸: Yh
[23/1/26, 11:54:51] Yi Hein: Hi everyone our next session is this today at 5.30pm at Kings Cross


Location: 5 Pancras Square
N1C 4AG
[23/1/26, 11:55:35] Haziq KXHL: when my dawg borges is writing love letters he’s all romanticism 🥰
when he gets rejected suddenly it’s “actually love is a monomaniacal symbol that annihilates the self” 🤓 ‎<This message was edited>
[23/1/26, 12:01:08] Haziq KXHL: that’s literally what those two poems are btw (borges asking someone out), class

nowadays we just say trash like:
“ok this is kinda random but would u wanna hang out sometime 👀”

and then whine abt a dating crisis like make effort pls
[23/1/26, 12:13:08] ~ Arinze: Anyone else feel AI is moving at the speed of light ? Everyday I wake up and there’s a new development/feature 😭
[23/1/26, 12:36:10] Haziq KXHL: honestly if gptzero flagged it that just means ur thinking too originally
[23/1/26, 12:38:39] Haziq KXHL: this is our gold standard referencing in my labs:

Smith, J. (2019?) Stuff. Journal of Things. Vol maybe. No ?? Pages yes.
https://website.com accessed yesterday

Smith 2019; Smith et al.; Smith & Smith
APA says (Smith, 2019) MLA says Smith 2019 Chicago refuses to comment

methodology: prayer
[23/1/26, 12:39:05] ~ manav: Sorry if this is obvious but do any of you use bibtex
[23/1/26, 12:39:21] ~ manav: I don’t even use ref managers anymore I just write them straight in bibtex and compile
[23/1/26, 12:39:24] ~ manav: It’s beautiful
‎[23/1/26, 12:39:54] ~ manav: It’s like this ‎image omitted
[23/1/26, 12:41:13] Haziq KXHL: same i just write them straight in bibtex and let god decide the order
[23/1/26, 12:42:12] ~ manav: wait why? the order in the .bib file doesn’t matter, the order is derived from your \cite order inline in the manuscript ‎<This message was edited>
‎[23/1/26, 12:42:53] ~ manav: Like so ‎image omitted
[23/1/26, 12:43:29] ~ manav: You can just do `\bibliographystyle{unsrt}`
[23/1/26, 12:43:29] Haziq KXHL: yeah ik but when u move one \cite earlier in the doc and suddenly the whole refs section reshuffles it still feels like divine intervention
[23/1/26, 12:43:49] ~ manav: oh for sure it’s way better than ref managers
[23/1/26, 12:45:00] ~ manav: Frankly I feel this way about a lot of command line stuff. The vibes are complex and difficult but in practice the closer you are to bare metal the fewer the problems you have
[23/1/26, 12:46:18] ~ manav: E.g. in the long run a VPS/dedicated is simpler than some hopped up cloud SaaS soln
[23/1/26, 12:47:56] ~ manav: Have any of ever tried google takeout for photos? It’s a nightmare. Google emails you your files in like 50 5gb zip files over the course of several days and cleaves the metadata from the photos into unreadable json so you need to use some janky github script to reconstruct the images and even then you’ll have data loss
[23/1/26, 12:49:17] ~ manav: Otoh if you are running immich on a 5TB hetzner box you will pay loose change and can just rsync the entire server image onto an old HDD you have lying around
‎[23/1/26, 12:50:17] ~ manav: h/t https://sive.rs/ti ‎image omitted
[23/1/26, 13:59:52] ~ samia 💗🌸: preach
[23/1/26, 14:00:23] ~ samia 💗🌸: i’ll start using it now ! i’ve never heard of it properly ‎<This message was edited>
[23/1/26, 14:01:01] ~ samia 💗🌸: yh i feel like ai detection is such a hot mess but theres always new updates coming out
[23/1/26, 14:05:16] Haziq KXHL: cloud storage is a hassle but i take solace in knowing that even if my photos are lost the NSA has them safely archived
[23/1/26, 14:27:15] Haziq KXHL: careful, bibtex / hard references introduce accountability which feels anti consulting 🤭
[23/1/26, 14:27:41] Haziq KXHL: shannon information content: 0
sorry i’m chronically annoyed by vacuously true statements. they give me nothing to bicker about
[23/1/26, 16:30:59] Yi Hein: Anyone else coming to KXHL hack session in 1hr? We might change location to UCL Refractory, DM me
[23/1/26, 16:32:44] Kings Cross Hack Lab: ‎You updated KXHL Hack Session
[23/1/26, 16:55:31] Yi Hein: ‎You deleted this message.
‎[23/1/26, 16:57:28] Yi Hein: We’ll be at UCL refractory today. Here’s how to get there from UCL Student Centre (WC1H 0AW) ‎video omitted
[23/1/26, 17:50:56] Haziq KXHL: guys guys if u have a rlly bad fever but also like a lot of work not in a grindset way but in a ppl-are-counting-on-you way what’s the strat
[23/1/26, 17:51:16] Haziq KXHL: do we gaslight the body
tell it to stop victim playing
remind it this is a first world problem
or hit it w “i literally study u for a living why are u acting brand new”
[23/1/26, 17:51:26] Haziq KXHL: asking for best practices
[23/1/26, 17:51:35] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Take painkillers and rest?
[23/1/26, 17:59:22] Suvadeep: ‎You added Suvadeep
[23/1/26, 18:05:44] Haziq KXHL: surely we’ve all been in situations with immense upstream pressure and downstream expectations and ur the single point of failure. don’t gatekeep what was ur strategy
[23/1/26, 18:08:29] Haziq KXHL: lowkey feels like karma tho my insolence levels went record high. sorry sorry sorry to anyone on the receiving end 🙏
[23/1/26, 18:13:21] Yi Hein: from my personal experience, ignoring your health for short term productivity, creates disproportionate losses in long term productivity (ie. being hospitalised for 3 weeks)
[23/1/26, 18:19:13] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Exactly!
[23/1/26, 18:19:25] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: I never work while I’m sick unless it’s mild and it’s like an exam or smt
[23/1/26, 18:26:00] Yi Hein: it’s one of those things with all nighters too, sleep debt repayment comes with interest. like turning nocturnal somewhat ok but the hours gotta be there, it’s a debate as to flow state efficiency gains vs sleep debt interest
[23/1/26, 18:28:44] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: 100%! I have NEVER stayed up for work. Suboptimal and messes you up more.
[23/1/26, 18:29:39] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: (And, no I get work done obviously - …Google me 😂!)
[23/1/26, 18:31:02] ~ samia 💗🌸: Agreed
[23/1/26, 18:31:03] Haziq KXHL: follow the doc’s advice guys, it’s just really tempting to externalize costs to future self when u’re running on half a prefrontal cortex
[23/1/26, 18:31:25] Haziq KXHL: dumb math says if i put in more hours rn i’ll net enough output to offset the shorter lifespan
[23/1/26, 18:33:44] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: It reduces the lifespan, prolly exponentially so haha
‎[23/1/26, 18:45:57] Yi Hein: btw guys for the MLP layer after the self-attention block, why do we not allow cross token transformations, but only allow token-wise transformations? ‎image omitted
[23/1/26, 18:54:19] Haziq KXHL: bro the token mixing already happened in self attention… why are you trying to remix the remix 💀
[23/1/26, 18:57:18] Haziq KXHL: but im just the LLM heckler in a room full of LLM adults 😭  @⁨~Tuhan Sapumanage⁩ u do this stuff right?
[23/1/26, 19:02:17] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Haha -ish. But pretty much what you said. Will type a longer answer shortly.
[23/1/26, 19:16:33] Yi Hein: I mean even if we don’t put the constraint ourselves, technically the model can still learn weights to do token-wise transformations if it wanted to
[23/1/26, 19:12:47] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Hey! Wanted to check I was right - basically we split encoding into two steps x -> x' -> y instead of x -> y (code for prior step is not in this snippet). What happens in x -> x' is giving each token local understanding of the context instead of doing all the permutations at once at x -> y. Computation is one reason but also avoids redundant learning… So you learn token-to-token relationships first at x -> x' and then apply the nonlinear function to with that information stored in tokens at x' -> y.
[23/1/26, 19:13:08] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: (I miss the predictive analytics class. So cerebral!)
[23/1/26, 19:22:38] Yi Hein: So all we are doing in the MLP layers is to improve the token embeddings before we go into the next attention block
[23/1/26, 19:29:15] Haziq KXHL: +1, great explanation from someone who acc knows what theyr doing 😄
[23/1/26, 19:36:43] Haziq KXHL: very big counterfactual. IRL the model is better off using self attention to incorporate context. we dont even need to tell it, the only constraint is good prediction,, the model does not want to commit hara kiri
[23/1/26, 19:37:54] Haziq KXHL: not quite… output of self attention layers tends to be enriched representation per tokens whereas output of MLP are feature sets which are most useful for your readout. in the special case of text generation yes ur point is totally valid
[23/1/26, 19:39:42] Haziq KXHL: @⁨~Tuhan Sapumanage⁩ pls correct me if im tripping
[23/1/26, 19:42:13] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: I think the higher level abstract is you can do it in one go but it wouldn’t generalise well because local representations would not be properly learned in ‘high resolution’ if you do a monolith-like one-off permutations for x -> y…
[23/1/26, 19:56:29] ~ manav: Is it still happening?
[23/1/26, 20:02:40] Haziq KXHL: @⁨Yi Hein⁩ broooooo u guys moved to icco’s or somewhere else??
[23/1/26, 20:08:37] Yi Hein: ah we left at 7pm
[23/1/26, 20:09:06] Yi Hein: come next week!
[23/1/26, 20:10:16] ~ Elma : Is iccos a good pizza spot
[23/1/26, 20:46:03] Yi Hein: it’s cheap and quick
[23/1/26, 20:47:36] Niv Ucl Builder: yes
[23/1/26, 20:48:25] ~ Elma : Ok I’m sold will deff be trying next time
[23/1/26, 20:49:54] Haziq KXHL: good if you’ve ever survived on meal deals. questionable if your taste buds are vc backed
[23/1/26, 20:50:32] ~ Elma : good thing I haven’t raised any debt 😳
[23/1/26, 21:11:22] Haziq KXHL: ok so angel round taste buds then. iccos is halal so cant complain. yet to find a spot at the intersection of authentic and halal. and yes i know italian pizza from stoner pizza cos i make my own sourdough. icco’s being sly putting a branch literally under a mosque. product market fit speedrun
[23/1/26, 21:14:09] ~ Elma : Lool I love that mosque so so much
[23/1/26, 21:14:22] ~ Elma : My fave pizza is pizza pilgrim
[23/1/26, 21:14:31] ~ Elma : But it’s like forced cos choices are limited
[23/1/26, 21:14:44] ~ Elma : I rlly wanna try crisp in mayfair
[23/1/26, 21:19:41] Haziq KXHL: when someone casually name drops a mayfair pizza place that’s how you know they’re keeping their vc backing hush hush. jk jk no need for pitchforks
[23/1/26, 21:21:59] ~ Elma : Using vc money in mayfair is deffo the failing founder playbook 😩
[23/1/26, 21:22:52] Haziq KXHL: agreed. super convenient when im actively trying not to bump into friends at ucl. no thank you to middle eastern geopolitics or theological edge cases or the muslim marriage industrial complex. yes pls to a quiet prayer space
[23/1/26, 21:24:20] Haziq KXHL: tbf actual pros take the vc money to vegas not mayfair
[23/1/26, 21:24:22] ~ Elma : It’s got good vibes
[23/1/26, 21:24:34] ~ Elma : Isnt it right down the road from ucl lol
[23/1/26, 21:24:44] ~ Elma : straight to the casinos
[23/1/26, 21:24:48] ~ Elma : Ur right
[23/1/26, 21:25:09] ~ Elma : I just think the raising debt culture is getting so out of hand
[23/1/26, 21:26:00] ~ Elma : It’s almost like ppl don’t even think profitable is cool anymore but $1M in funding is cooler 😍
[23/1/26, 21:29:03] Haziq KXHL: yes thats why its convenient. uni prayer spaces are crazy. people actively matchmaking for sport. so id rather take the short walk thank u instead of being soft launched into a relationship
[23/1/26, 21:31:31] ~ Elma : Oh fairs that makes sense
[23/1/26, 21:31:36] ~ Elma : Yikes
[23/1/26, 21:32:10] Haziq KXHL: partly driven by the growing private credit ecosystem w basically no regulation and very asymmetric risk. lenders and founders lowkey messing around with ppl’s pensions and the whole economy knowing the govt will bail them out
[23/1/26, 21:33:16] Haziq KXHL: SVB was already bad and that was regulated. private credit via Apollo et al is somehow even looser
[23/1/26, 21:35:11] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Such a fun comvo but I’m in middle of a meeting 😂😭
[23/1/26, 21:42:25] Haziq KXHL: capitalism is fine when capital is allocated to productive risk. this is just rent seeking and regulatory arbitrage undermining the whole premise. Varoufakis is by no means a socialist and this is what he’s been warning abt. not much to do once bad actors hit critical mass and capture the system
[23/1/26, 21:43:23] ~ Elma : Omg u text like ur writing an essay 😂😂😂😂
[23/1/26, 21:43:39] ~ Elma : Et al in a regular convo is crazy work
[23/1/26, 21:43:52] Haziq KXHL: academia brainrot
[23/1/26, 21:47:23] ~ Elma : Yh deffo but generally speaking I think most top VC funds are regulated I think my issue is the culture/perception of fundraising has been glamorised so deeply that a profitable normal business is no longer seen as attractive/successful- you could make 1M YoY with good cash flow no debt and ppl in our generation will weirdly glorify the broke founder that’s negative 1M and will most likely do a terrible job at deploying that capital then they go bust x
[23/1/26, 21:48:13] ~ Elma : But still they’re seen as more cool… it’s weird
[23/1/26, 21:48:21] ~ Elma : Anyways
[23/1/26, 21:48:28] ~ Elma : Anyone here applied for EF?
[23/1/26, 21:48:36] Haziq KXHL: lol
[23/1/26, 21:48:55] ~ Elma : Shes such a hypocrite 😳
[23/1/26, 21:48:58] ~ Elma : Omg rlly
[23/1/26, 21:49:12] Haziq KXHL: Pre socialism bug biting me, yup
[23/1/26, 21:49:13] ~ Elma : Send us a vn of ur experience plz
[23/1/26, 21:50:07] Haziq KXHL: in fact i would say EF selection process was a contributing factor
[23/1/26, 21:50:34] ~ Elma : Yh I don’t like how they do it ngl it seems v academia focused
[23/1/26, 21:50:44] ~ Elma : But then they promote this whole outlier model
[23/1/26, 21:50:54] ~ Elma : But outliers arent obsessed w school….
‎[23/1/26, 21:51:08] Haziq KXHL: sorry we don’t do voice calls or notes lol ‎image omitted
[23/1/26, 21:51:37] ~ Elma : that’s like the most millennial meme ever lol
[23/1/26, 21:51:50] ~ Elma : How can a vn be seen as ancient my goodness
[23/1/26, 21:51:53] ~ Elma : Anywaus
[23/1/26, 21:51:56] ~ Elma : Did u get in?
[23/1/26, 21:52:14] Haziq KXHL: pls hold while i recollect the trauma
[23/1/26, 21:52:28] ~ Elma : Idk if the 10% equity is worth tje programme
[23/1/26, 21:52:46] ~ Elma : Is there a dilution clause u can sign?
[23/1/26, 21:53:26] ~ Elma : Patiently waiting at front row 🙁
[23/1/26, 21:54:13] Haziq KXHL: ok so EF is deep science / deep tech & intellectual property / patent forward like you u noted
[23/1/26, 21:54:55] Haziq KXHL: which was acc perfect for me as i was a synthetic biology / bioengineering intern at great ormond street research dept during the time of my application
[23/1/26, 21:55:04] ~ Elma : I see
[23/1/26, 21:55:14] ~ Elma : Yes makes sense
[23/1/26, 21:55:48] Haziq KXHL: and i had already won a few biotech startup competitions and received interest from other VCs and biotech companies so had the clout EF was expecting
[23/1/26, 21:56:35] Haziq KXHL: also my supervisor at great ormond street was a bit of legend in the field and he gave a unnecessarily generous recommendation like this kid might be 18 but he knows what he’s doing etc.
[23/1/26, 21:56:46] ~ Elma : Aweee that’s kind
[23/1/26, 21:57:11] ~ Elma : Yh the clout is mandatory
‎[23/1/26, 21:57:39] ~ Elma : ‎audio omitted
[23/1/26, 21:57:41] Haziq KXHL: so me being me sent them an application riddled w memes and tongue in cheek comments and also a bit of serious science… and they acc rated it highly
[23/1/26, 21:57:48] ~ Elma : Lemme be patient 😔
[23/1/26, 21:57:54] ~ Elma : Oh….
[23/1/26, 21:57:58] ~ Elma : LOL WHAT
[23/1/26, 21:58:18] ~ Elma : Ah tied w seriousness fairs
[23/1/26, 21:58:28] Haziq KXHL: yeah i was literally mocking VCs in my application lol and they were like this kid is an outlier like what the hell
[23/1/26, 21:58:32] ~ Elma : Can’t deny intellect no matter the format ig
[23/1/26, 21:59:28] ~ Elma : I think the outlier studf may have been ur prior track record and they liked ur personality?
[23/1/26, 21:59:34] ~ Elma : Anyways wjere does it go wrong
[23/1/26, 22:00:55] Haziq KXHL: they even said stuff u r 99th percentile of talent in the country in their technical interview bit and me being an arrogant prick at that time was like ofc ofc 🙂‍↕️ which they acc rated highly cos that’s the founder mindset apparently
[23/1/26, 22:01:21] ~ Elma : HAHAHAHHA
[23/1/26, 22:01:25] ~ Elma : healthy arrogance
[23/1/26, 22:02:23] Haziq KXHL: so they were like ur just 18, the youngest founder we’ve had is like 21 so keep up your work and we’ll mentor u till ur bit more grown up cos u can’t talk to investors and stuff being goofy like this
[23/1/26, 22:02:41] ~ Elma : Youngest is 21?
[23/1/26, 22:03:03] ~ Elma : That’s mad cos I swr the Ceo talking abt 17 year olds applying
[23/1/26, 22:03:10] ~ Elma : But it may be a risk thibg
[23/1/26, 22:03:20] ~ Elma : That’s kinda sweet of them awe
[23/1/26, 22:04:25] Haziq KXHL: _applying_
since it’s like deep tech / R&D intensive they said more experience helps…
[23/1/26, 22:04:57] Haziq KXHL: but yes was in touch w them for while and then sorta fell out, had a heated debate lol and then was like im done w this
‎[23/1/26, 22:06:10] ~ Elma : ‎audio omitted
[23/1/26, 22:07:50] Haziq KXHL: yes didn’t acc go through the EF programme, they said we’ll enroll u down the line but like i said, fell out w them…
[23/1/26, 22:08:17] ~ Elma : Fairsss mate
[23/1/26, 22:08:23] ~ Elma : Good run
[23/1/26, 22:10:27] Hera KXHL: discussion came in time I was just about to sacrifice some sleep
[23/1/26, 22:19:15] Haziq KXHL: i dont condone the lack of intellectual humility you see in tech, startups, finance etc. i used to conflate compensation and clout with talent. IRL real talent is a postdoc doing unforgiving unrewarded research in a tiny cubicle at UCL
[23/1/26, 22:23:23] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: People without humility are fun to hang around if you’re game too
[23/1/26, 22:23:38] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: And have guardrails around that attitude obv
[23/1/26, 22:24:49] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: And honestly they’re easy to work with tbh
[23/1/26, 22:24:59] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Just that you need to be game too
[23/1/26, 22:26:26] ~ Elma : how is it easy? They’re usually insufferable
[23/1/26, 22:27:05] ~ Elma : The best founders I’ve met have absolutely no ego and are so unique they’re literally in a world/league of their own
[23/1/26, 22:28:40] Haziq KXHL: its more that in these industries ppl get paid a lot for work that’s relatively trivial by frontier research standards then develop a bit of a god complex. IRL theyr often just slightly less stupid than their coworkers. contrast that with the insane intellectual output of a min wage phd student. yes the phd situation is self inflicted but calling big tech or high finance “talent” is just laughable
[23/1/26, 22:35:55] Haziq KXHL: the idea that you’re “game” vanishes surprisingly quickly when you put yourself in rooms with real talent density like i mean. then the focus shifts from posturing to frantically writing down every small insight so you don’t miss a detail and just learning by osmosis
[23/1/26, 22:36:19] Haziq KXHL: altho we should probably disambiguate what we mean by “talent”. in my world it’s purely intellectual output. in these industries talent is more like lying thieving and whatever else helps you get ahead in the rat race. if you win the game then congrats you’re “talented”
[23/1/26, 22:36:20] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: It’s a whole thing to decompress intellect into agency vs cognition and so on and yeah I generally get alone with the whole spectrum so no pref per se but so far I found it easier to work with skills augmented with arrogance than with humility. 
But yeah again it’s a whole convo does arrogance means compensate for lack of skills or humility means hedging bets… that’s for later too exhausted
[23/1/26, 22:37:45] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: So skills are non-negotiable but augmentation is what I referred to
[23/1/26, 22:37:50] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Idk does it make sense?
[23/1/26, 22:38:07] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Not that you agree but the message adds up? 😂
[23/1/26, 22:40:05] ~ Elma : It makes complete sense and I agree I think haziq is implying society perceives high agency ppl as talented but rlly they’re not bc you can make a shitttt ton of money cos ur high agency but not be too bright
[23/1/26, 22:40:23] ~ Elma : I’ve oversimplified it but that’s my understanding of the 2 arguments
[23/1/26, 22:40:26] Haziq KXHL: imo i’ve personally made it a point to work only with the intersection of skill and humility. it’s a positive feedback loop. it makes me a better person and it makes ppl with that disposition more receptive to you so they actually help you improve holistically. empathy etc is just as important a metric for me to optimize long term as skill
[23/1/26, 22:40:47] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Intellectual output is just one axis. When you have row cognition whether you choose to optimise in that axis or more infinite games where output is multifaceted. It’s not exactly right to say one is cognitively smarter cuz they doubled down on a single axis!
[23/1/26, 22:41:18] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: ^^
[23/1/26, 22:41:57] ~ Elma : This is cute bless
[23/1/26, 22:43:45] ~ Elma : Omg
[23/1/26, 22:43:57] ~ Elma : This is lowkey making me deep my life
[23/1/26, 22:44:05] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Anywayyy goodnight London. I’m so exhausted 😂
[23/1/26, 22:44:09] ~ Elma : My biggest problem is ik how to make money
[23/1/26, 22:44:25] Haziq KXHL: that’s a very pleasant problem to have ngl
[23/1/26, 22:44:31] ~ Elma : But it’s not intellectually stimulating enough 😩😩😩😩
[23/1/26, 22:44:34] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: What? 😂
[23/1/26, 22:44:43] ~ Elma : Alhamdulilah
[23/1/26, 22:45:23] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: I genuinely can’t think of something more intellectually stimulating 😂😂
[23/1/26, 22:45:35] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: It’s so multicsted, stochastic and fun
[23/1/26, 22:45:36] ~ Elma : Bc society perceives you as talented by certain metrics so let’s go with haziqs high agency variable BUT u don’t feel that way cos it’s easy
[23/1/26, 22:45:41] ~ Elma : Does that make sense?
[23/1/26, 22:45:56] ~ Elma : Hmm I guess
[23/1/26, 22:46:10] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Just do a self-audit and vectorise yourself against others I mean it’s not that deep 😂
[23/1/26, 22:46:18] Haziq KXHL: الحمدلله على كل حال وزمان
[23/1/26, 22:46:36] ~ Elma : But good businesses are boring and predictable it gets to a point where yk which problems you’ll anticipate and how youll solve them
[23/1/26, 22:47:09] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: …you mirror thoughts I had before my first start-up 😭
[23/1/26, 22:47:09] ~ Elma : I also worked for an excellent startup and quite closely to the ceo so decision making is easier for me ajd less mental gymnastics
[23/1/26, 22:47:15] ~ Elma : Wdym
[23/1/26, 22:47:23] ~ Elma : Guys pls ur scaring me
[23/1/26, 22:47:28] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: It gets competenrive especially as competitors catch up
[23/1/26, 22:47:34] ~ Elma : Wdym vectorise
[23/1/26, 22:47:56] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Ljke where you’re vs others so you know if it’s a genuine skill
[23/1/26, 22:48:00] ~ Elma : My competitors arent too innovative and seem slow could be wrong tho
[23/1/26, 22:48:16] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: You haven’t done it at scale then?
[23/1/26, 22:48:23] ~ Elma : Ah I see - compared to the general population?
[23/1/26, 22:48:42] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Ish but personally I do to people better than me smh 😭
[23/1/26, 22:49:04] ~ Elma : It’s long to explain but not at scale at all - it’s a lucrative model that works without macro scale
[23/1/26, 22:49:18] ~ Elma : Hmmmm I do compare myself to top founders
[23/1/26, 22:49:22] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Interestinggg tell us everything
[23/1/26, 22:49:37] ~ Elma : And then u steal my money 🙄
[23/1/26, 22:49:47] ~ Elma : Tuhan how old are u?
[23/1/26, 22:49:50] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Bro 😂
[23/1/26, 22:49:51] ~ Elma : If u don’t mind sharing
[23/1/26, 22:49:53] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Guess
[23/1/26, 22:50:01] ~ Elma : I can’t tell if bro is 28 or 23
[23/1/26, 22:50:06] ~ Elma : Ur giving wise uncle
[23/1/26, 22:50:14] ~ Elma : Gna go w 25
[23/1/26, 22:50:23] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Good guess well done!
[23/1/26, 22:50:27] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: 24
[23/1/26, 22:50:31] ~ Elma : Thanks
[23/1/26, 22:50:43] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: But company 11 and degree at 13 so 😂
[23/1/26, 22:50:50] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: I should stop telling that 😭
[23/1/26, 22:50:53] ~ Elma : oh wow wth
[23/1/26, 22:50:56] Haziq KXHL: lowkey disillusioned by intellectual stimulation. being in a place like great ormond street (serious paediatric cases and hard to treat cancers) teaches you that much. it makes you feel powerless regardless of intellect talent whatever. all my colleagues there were absolutely brilliant scientists taking pay cuts to be there even though other work would’ve been more intellectually stimulating and or lucrative
[23/1/26, 22:51:03] ~ Elma : Drop the linkedin wthhh
[23/1/26, 22:51:15] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Just my name
[23/1/26, 22:51:28] Haziq KXHL: *apologies if i sound preachy
[23/1/26, 22:51:51] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Againnn one axis vs multifaceted tradeoff
[23/1/26, 22:51:59] ~ Elma : Yh I think that’s honestly so sad but closest I’ve felt this pain is when I read Frankenstein 😩
[23/1/26, 22:52:34] ~ Elma : Not to be offensive at all but to ur point abt intellectual stimulation in tjis field it’s just so impossible
[23/1/26, 22:52:38] ~ Elma : I’d dial it down xx ‎<This message was edited>
[23/1/26, 22:52:58] ~ Elma : Have u exited before?
[23/1/26, 22:53:00] Haziq KXHL: careful arguing tradeoffs with ppl who work in paediatric cancer wards 😭
[23/1/26, 22:53:01] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: You mean to me?
[23/1/26, 22:53:09] ~ Elma : No haziq
[23/1/26, 22:53:13] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Once yeah but modest :)
[23/1/26, 22:53:27] ~ Elma : guys hes so cool
[23/1/26, 22:53:44] ~ Elma : Have u been to yi hiens sessions before?
[23/1/26, 22:53:54] ~ Elma : Right full attendance from all of us next time
[23/1/26, 22:53:55] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: That’s a very emotionally blackmailing statement. My aunt (cancer doctor/oncologist) did the same move 😅
[23/1/26, 22:54:02] Haziq KXHL: sorry can u pls clarify ur question?
[23/1/26, 22:54:18] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Look forward to but schedules are crazy lately but def will soon!
[23/1/26, 22:54:59] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Anyway good night people. If I stay I’ll keep talking. Extrovert 😅
[23/1/26, 22:55:42] Haziq KXHL: im not emotionally blackmailing anyone. just saying most of us arent meaningfully contributing to paediatric cancer research so basic respect for the ppl who do feels warranted
[23/1/26, 22:56:24] ~ Elma : Not a q just meant i empathise w feeling intellectually powerless or even pushing ur self intellectually in those fields is near to impossible - I wouldnt push myself into a field like that but I would appreciate just a slightly higher dial if that makes sense
[23/1/26, 22:56:36] ~ Elma : 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
[23/1/26, 22:56:50] Haziq KXHL: which also means not diminishing their work by calling it “single axis”. like what exactly is our multifaceted contribution here?
[23/1/26, 22:57:32] Haziq KXHL: have u read the Greek legend of sisyphus pushing the boulder up a mountain?
[23/1/26, 22:57:56] ~ Elma : Not read but heard of it
[23/1/26, 22:58:04] ~ Elma : Spoil it
[23/1/26, 22:58:46] Haziq KXHL: i grew up reading 20th century French existentialism… what i learn from Camus is “one must imagine Sisyphus smiling”
[23/1/26, 22:59:32] ~ Elma : cut the riddles it’s 11pm 😩
[23/1/26, 22:59:45] ~ Elma : Whay does that mean
[23/1/26, 22:59:56] ~ Elma : What does Sisyphus represent
[23/1/26, 23:00:12] Haziq KXHL: one sec, lemme elaborate…
[23/1/26, 23:01:40] Haziq KXHL: we should keep doing what’s right even if it feels powerless and even if the impact is likely to be small or in vain
[23/1/26, 23:03:49] ~ Elma : I live by this ngl
[23/1/26, 23:04:15] ~ Elma : Gna add to my reading list
[23/1/26, 23:04:37] Haziq KXHL: in the story sisyphus is cursed to push a boulder up a mountain just for it to fall back down every time. camus takes that and says that’s basically the human condition, doing work with no guaranteed payoff, and the act of smiling and choosing to keep pushing anyway is where the meaning comes from
[23/1/26, 23:08:46] Haziq KXHL: higher dial is nice but a lot of those dials are in the wrong places. in my experience the most important work is structurally deincentivised which is exactly what makes it important. if you don’t want to contribute to it there are very few others willing to make that sacrifice
[23/1/26, 23:16:42] Haziq KXHL: idk why tech ppl get so defensive when i say this. i actually know these ppl and there’s zero sanctimony. it’s just duty and trauma like ive seen things and now i cant unsee them. so there’s no need to diminish their contribution to level the moral playing field. they never asked for a moral high horse in the first place
[23/1/26, 23:22:53] Haziq KXHL: and while the point about optimising for power prestige etc in the short term for more impact in the long term is compelling in theory, we all know they dont actually get out of bed thinking about global problems or long term impact. so there’s no need for posturing here. there’s no realistic future where they move the needle on these things especially when selling their souls has basically become the initiation ritual for success in their industry
[23/1/26, 23:26:31] Haziq KXHL: @⁨~Elma ⁩ pls sanity check am i speaking in tongues or is there at least a kernel of coherent thought in there 😵‍💫
[23/1/26, 23:28:10] Haziq KXHL: u must excuse me. filters are lower than usual cos i have a fever
[23/1/26, 23:28:11] ~ Elma : Ur not I just need to get my work done and clean my desk and sleep 😩😩😩😩
[23/1/26, 23:28:58] Haziq KXHL: totally fair go do your thing. hope you get a good rest ✌️
[23/1/26, 23:37:38] ~ Elma : And you!!!
[23/1/26, 23:38:09] Haziq KXHL: lol eventually, my GC essay is only half complete
[23/1/26, 23:39:59] Haziq KXHL: also reading jean-paul sartre (another 20th century french existentialist) during my most impressionable years cooked my brain in a very specific way. radical detachment from the socially acceptable school -> work -> relationship -> marriage -> kids -> death pipeline and mental freedom to care about stuff that actually matters
[23/1/26, 23:42:50] Haziq KXHL: *downside is being disadvantaged in the dating market where long term earning potential and life stability matter. “hi im biomedical research’s sacrificial lamb” is as much a conversation starter as it is a conversation ender 😖
[24/1/26, 10:36:34] Haziq KXHL: @⁨~manav⁩ how we feeling abt sapolsky’s hard determinism / “no free will” rhetoric sensei?
[24/1/26, 11:13:52] ~ manav: I don’t think biology is the right level of abstraction for stuff like this
[24/1/26, 13:17:52] Haziq KXHL: i understand ur point abt consciousness but sapolsky’s simply suggesting that consciousness might not be the _primum movens_ we think it is in light of Libet’s experiments which seems like a pretty modest claim?
[24/1/26, 13:19:42] ~ Ada Ge: Hey everyone, the first Ambitious Impact x High Impact Engineers event is scheduled!

Taimaka is a global health charity, working to scale a cost-effective treatment model for addressing pedriatric malnutrition.

[24/1/26, 13:20:37] ~ manav: Libets experiments still presuppose the experiencer of the experiments! If you want to deconstruct free will you have to go up to the conceptual layer
[24/1/26, 13:20:49] Yi Hein: this one is fine
[24/1/26, 13:21:04] ~ Ada Ge: ‎This message was deleted.
[24/1/26, 13:21:57] ~ manav: LMFAO I saw that Ada
[24/1/26, 13:22:34] ~ manav: Which is to say that you really only have 2 options. If an action is predictable then it is determined, and if it is indeterminate then its stochastic which is still no kind of freedom at all
[24/1/26, 13:22:38] ~ Ada Ge: i accidentally hit enter T-T
[24/1/26, 13:24:00] Haziq KXHL: i get that Libet presupposes an experiencer, but why does that automatically smuggle in free will? can’t u keep the experiencer and just bracket the idea that they’re the originator of action?
[24/1/26, 13:24:58] Haziq KXHL: ngl that’s starting to sound exactly like sapolsky’s framing lol
[24/1/26, 13:25:53] ~ manav: To break this down further, free will is generally understood to mean “if you ran the causal chain back and replayed, the agent could have chosen differently”. If an agent’s actions  predictably arise from fixed causal interaction then it’s determined. If there is some sort of stochasticity introduced by QM or whatever it’s random, not freedom
[24/1/26, 13:26:38] ~ manav: I have little issue with his conclusions. I have an issue with overlapping magisteria. What is the relevance of neurobiology here? It’s scientism
[24/1/26, 13:26:56] ~ manav: This is a modal argument
[24/1/26, 13:27:43] Haziq KXHL: tbh i was kinda anticipating ur contention to be something like: if sapolsky thinks all thought and behaviour are strictly determined by environment, history, etc, then reason sort of loses its credence since that implies he’s asserting hard determinism simply bc his neurons forced him lol
[24/1/26, 13:28:14] ~ manav: That you can see brain centres “deciding” before a person is aware of their decision is totally downstream of a particular modal understanding of causality
[24/1/26, 13:29:13] ~ manav: The only respectable alternative to this modal understanding imo is to supplant your causality totally with divine occasionalism lol
[24/1/26, 13:30:53] ~ manav: No I think this is fine. My criticism of the consciousness incompleteness problem is specifically because asserting quale nonexistence destabilises the medium you’ve used to gather the evidence
[24/1/26, 13:31:15] ~ manav: If it’s causally determined that sapolsky defends hard determinism that still has nothing to do with its veracity
[24/1/26, 13:33:31] ~ manav: You are grasping at my meta-pattern pretty well but I’ll just explicitly tell you. I am opposed to turning empiricism backwards onto the instruments which generate the conditions for empirical enquiry to be fruitful
[24/1/26, 13:35:31] ~ manav: And my entire research interest  in neuro is disproof by counterexample. No empirical theory of primordial awareness is viable and you demonstrate this by establishing continuity in states of ego-compromise
[24/1/26, 13:36:45] ~ manav: E.g. if someone has one of those insane left hemisphere strokes that compromises the self-other distinction but is capable of recalling and reporting that state it becomes obvious that what we typically consider to be “mind” is circuit-emergent and there is something else watching all this shit play out
[24/1/26, 13:38:21] Haziq KXHL: lol at this point i literally have a lil black notebook titled “what manav is trying to tell us” so yeah hopefully i’m getting the meta pattern 😭 but i rate it highly, this is why Rovelli is able to mess with our notions of space and time way more deeply than Einstein ever did
[24/1/26, 13:38:51] ~ manav: When someone is having a total psychotic episode there is an unperturbed experiencer watching the total breakdown of ipseity, ego-scoping, etc
[24/1/26, 13:39:24] ~ manav: If I can make this distinction canon in neuroscientific thought I will consider my career to have been worthwhile
[24/1/26, 13:40:53] Haziq KXHL: but what do u say abt cases like that tho? rovelli isn’t doing this for vibes, it feels like the actual trajectory of physical inquiry just keeps pushing us toward conclusions that kinda collapse our empiricism 😵‍💫
[24/1/26, 13:41:24] ~ manav: Scoped empiricism is not collapsed empiricism
[24/1/26, 13:41:33] ~ manav: It’s actually stronger
[24/1/26, 13:41:45] ~ manav: Because you affirm the conditions which make empirical enquiry valid
[24/1/26, 13:42:17] ~ manav: That there exists a threshold means that we don’t waste our time on mysticism in the lab
[24/1/26, 13:45:05] ~ manav: And consider that by giving the awareness/mind distinction empirical dignity it becomes part of a broader toolset you can use in therapeutic contexts. When people talk about meditation in psychotherapy it’s always this wooly experiential stuff. “Wow! Mindfulness meditation shown to reduce xyz undesirable states!” If you can affirm the existence of awareness as ground, you can offer this as an actual true thing to people who are suffering from internal discontinuity, severe angst, etc.
[24/1/26, 13:45:56] ~ manav: You are already in possession of a harbour of stability upon which discontinuity plays out. My intuition is that simply driving that wedge there in a way that isn’t maladaptive or dissociative will have huge therapeutic value
[24/1/26, 14:08:58] Haziq KXHL: but don’t u think all of this is still possible under materialism  without positing a mind-awareness dualism? like awareness could just be way more distributed and robust than the stuff we usually call “mind” which is why it survives those breakdowns, without needing to treat it as ontologically separate
[24/1/26, 14:16:11] Haziq KXHL: also doesn’t the fact that these interventions are literally physical stimuli that reliably interact with and modulate awareness kinda point toward a materialist story?
[24/1/26, 14:19:19] Haziq KXHL: tbh i’d even go beyond the delocalisation of awareness and say the mind itself probably isn’t straightforwardly circuit emergent either bc how the heck do we explain planaria retaining memories after literal head decapitation + regeneration
[24/1/26, 14:22:58] ~ Ada Ge: https://x.com/i/status/2014352359351107676

what's going on here neuroscientists?
[24/1/26, 14:24:59] Haziq KXHL: my initial reaction to Libet was actually that “consciousness” might be sub neuronal and i think there’s at least some credence to that. like with Hameroff’s work on anaesthetics interacting with microtubules (no comment on the fractal time crystal stuff, beautiful but strong side eye from quantum mechanics lol). also Nick Lane (who’s acc with us at UCL!) shows that xenon gas which is basically an amorphous electronic cloud with no real structure seems to act by messing with the electron transport chain rather than any classic neurochemical interaction which would normally require structure
[24/1/26, 14:25:56] ~ manav: I’ll respond properly soon but the reason it isn’t is because we are mixing levels. Planeria experiments etc all operate within the constraints of experience ‎<This message was edited>
[24/1/26, 14:26:38] ~ manav: So if we are like “awareness is distributed and robust whilst mind is localised and fragile” we are just adding another layer of abstraction, the observer just moves backwards
[24/1/26, 14:28:19] ~ manav: So it’s not that experiments validate the existence of the awareness it’s that they both disprove totally material accounts for the awareness-body-mind complex and disprove non-material accounts of the body-mind complex
[24/1/26, 14:28:22] ~ manav: Does this make sense
[24/1/26, 14:29:14] ~ manav: Look into Francisco Varela and Michael Bitbol’s works
[24/1/26, 14:31:20] ~ manav: I am actually (tentatively) a hard materialist on mind - a true neurophenomenologist who doesn’t make the awareness-mind distinction will say that any theory of mind is just isomorphic to 1st person experience
[24/1/26, 14:31:40] ~ manav: Whereas I am saying that a good account of mind may account for the actual substance and structure of it
[24/1/26, 14:32:36] ~ manav: And the reason is that mental activity is an object to my awareness in the same way a water bottle is an object to my experience so I have no good reason to impose a substance dualism beyond the privacy of my mental activity
[24/1/26, 14:51:17] ~ Ada Ge: https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2502791122 sure you've all seen this but interesting to me
[24/1/26, 14:54:00] Haziq KXHL: ok wait lemme get this straight. so you think when we say “awareness is more robust” we’re really saying “there exists some X that instantiates awareness more robustly” so X just ends up being the observer pushed backwards. but i’m just treating awareness as a state of the system like any other 3rd describable property. so why is it important to you to protect the 1st person character of awareness here?
[24/1/26, 14:55:45] ~ manav: Because you don’t encounter anything outside of your 1st person experience of it
[24/1/26, 14:55:54] ~ manav: Even consensus occurs within your 1st person experience
[24/1/26, 14:56:31] ~ manav: There is no 3rd describable probability without the 1st
[24/1/26, 14:56:33] Haziq KXHL: ada pls explain ur reasoning behind assuming we’ve all ingested every obscure PNAS paper w just 1 citation, we’re not LLMs for goodness sake 😭
[24/1/26, 15:01:46] ~ Ada Ge: i mean
[24/1/26, 15:01:54] ~ Ada Ge: i get these from people i follow on twitter
[24/1/26, 15:02:02] ~ Ada Ge: and manav is on twitter sometimes he mentioned
[24/1/26, 15:02:09] ~ Ada Ge: so i thought he would see the same ones
[24/1/26, 15:02:49] ~ Ada Ge: it's surprising how similar how similar my feeds are to some of my friends, im like "have you seen this" and 80% of the time they're like "yeah i saw that yesterday"
[24/1/26, 15:09:48] ~ manav: I’m pretty offline these days
[24/1/26, 15:15:43] Haziq KXHL: ok cool i buy that we don’t have a god’s eye view and that everything is accessed via 1st person experience. but if that blocks materialism about awareness, doesn’t it also block materialism about basically everything else? like even science itself is all only ever encountered that way too so why does awareness get singled out? i guess this is where your foundationalism comes in where you’d say making awareness special keeps the rest of materialism mostly intact but that feels like paying a pretty high cost in arbitrariness. it seems more like sufficiency than necessity and as an existentialist i’m not really inclined to put mind or awareness on that kind of pedestal
[24/1/26, 15:16:43] ~ manav: Awareness, or pure subject, is the maximally reduced epistemological postulate necessary to ground the existence of objects
[24/1/26, 15:17:16] ~ manav: Awareness gets singled out because it doesn’t make sense to treat anything else as functionally transcendental
[24/1/26, 15:20:16] ~ manav: What I am saying is that the ecosystem of material things plays out within awareness, and when we describe something as “material” what we are really saying is that it is induction apt. Material things are knowable via a correspondence view of truth
[24/1/26, 15:23:53] Haziq KXHL: ok so you are making a necessity claim. but isn’t there a bit of a fly-in-the-bottle move here? this “pure subject” or “awareness” is starting to look like Aquinas’ plastic god. it’s not clear to me how that thing relates to awareness as people actually describe it or to the awareness you’re saying people can meaningfully interact with in therapeutic contexts
[24/1/26, 15:26:13] Haziq KXHL: also worth saying that analytic philosophy loves asserting uniqueness of maximally reduced postulates but in formal logic uniqueness isn’t free
[24/1/26, 15:28:44] ~ manav: I think it’s pretty clear - it’s the fact of experiencing itself, prior to thought. It’s not “accessed” in the way objects are because it is the prerequisite of objectification. Insofar as it doesn’t agree with the vernacular understanding of awareness I’m happy to call it something else. “Pure subject” is too abstract and “consciousness” is the exact complex we are trying to decompose
[24/1/26, 15:32:00] ~ manav: The reason it isn’t “fly in the bottle” is that we attempt to push the ground backwards on pain of vicious regress. Mental events are observed by A. But A is a fly in a bottle so how do we preclude some B grounding A? But this means that A is now just another object to the subject. Why wouldn’t B be an object to some C? And so on
[24/1/26, 15:33:21] Haziq KXHL: oh wow ok but now it feels like you’ve just severed the link between your “awareness” and lived reality. if it’s just a placeholder label for a maximally minimal condition, then it’s not obviously the thing people report or stabilise in therapy anymore which kinda strips it of the therapeutic implications you were motivating this with in the first place
[24/1/26, 15:34:36] ~ manav: This is extremely abstruse so lmk if you want me to explain anything better
[24/1/26, 15:37:26] Haziq KXHL: also the lack of a uniqueness proof is still doing a lot of damage here. unless you’re willing to say you’d accept any minimal condition as the ground, you’ve got an arbitrariness problem and if you do accept any of them then identification becomes a nightmare
[24/1/26, 15:39:56] ~ manav: Actually I disagree. The thing people stabilise in therapy is mind. Awareness is the fact of subjectivity, it doesn’t need stabilisation. In other words, a state of angst and destabilisation is nonetheless an experienced thing.

The therapeutic mechanism here is inducing mind-states that prompt the recognition of the stable awareness that belies  whatever turbulent mind-states that person is suffering with. The therapeutic value is not contingent on that awareness being an active and dynamic thing, just the opposite
[24/1/26, 15:39:56] ~ manav: Sorry I’m underground so my messages are slow
[24/1/26, 15:45:00] ~ manav: It’s absolutely not an arbitrary placeholder either. It’s not an entity that exists outside of you or anything like that. I am literally talking about the raw fact of your experience of the world
[24/1/26, 15:45:38] ~ manav: Uniqueness proofs are incoherent here because a proof is posterior to the experience that discloses it to you
[24/1/26, 15:50:26] Haziq KXHL: awareness as a maximally reductive postulate that grounds materialism is still a ways away from being the static anchor of mind you’re invoking here, feels like a non sequitur
[24/1/26, 15:51:24] Haziq KXHL: platonic space is like right there you know
[24/1/26, 15:51:55] ~ manav: Why exactly is it a ways away
[24/1/26, 15:52:07] ~ manav: Are you opposed to the capaciousness? Is it doing too much work?
[24/1/26, 15:52:18] ~ manav: You’d surely expect the ontological ground to do quite a lot of work
[24/1/26, 15:54:29] ~ manav: Yes and it’s less of a mindfuck too. But I’m asking you to take seriously the idea that you have never interacted with a table, only a table within your experience. Your experience is grounding the table
[24/1/26, 15:55:41] ~ manav: I wish I could recommend Bernardo Kastrup to you rn but I just do not like his framing of this stuff. If you are willing to overlook his specific vocabulary I am basically making the same point he does in “analytic idealism in a nutshell” ‎<This message was edited>
[24/1/26, 15:56:47] ~ manav: https://philpapers.org/archive/KASAIA-3.pdf
[24/1/26, 15:57:08] Haziq KXHL: i mean i can also identify that same maximally reductive postulate as a bunch of other very concrete things people interact with. the “static thing that’s supposed to ground mind” you’re appealing to is already a very specific object. it just becomes an identification problem
[24/1/26, 15:57:38] ~ manav: Make the argument. What other candidates do you have in mind
[24/1/26, 15:58:23] ~ manav: The existence of experience is the sole given fact of reality
[24/1/26, 15:58:54] Haziq KXHL: don’t tempt me lol. i can just as easily identify it as the os being booted, a background process that never closes or the universe successfully not segfaulting
[24/1/26, 15:59:23] ~ manav: You have never known any of these possible conditions outside of your own experience of them
[24/1/26, 15:59:32] ~ manav: Pesky observer
[24/1/26, 16:01:07] Haziq KXHL: what if i start pulling stuff from platonic space which is upstream of all our experiences?
[24/1/26, 16:01:43] ~ manav: Woah woah woah since when is platonic space upstream of experience
[24/1/26, 16:02:46] ~ manav: Platonic space is still a known thing. An object of knowledge cannot be ontologically prior to the subject
[24/1/26, 16:03:28] ~ manav: Awareness is a candidate for the maximally reduced postulate because it is the act of knowing itself
[24/1/26, 16:07:21] Haziq KXHL: since levin and friston entered the chat tbh.
SoTA platonic space just dropped and now it apparently generates subjects
[24/1/26, 16:08:24] ~ manav: I think levin/Friston provide a very compelling account for the objects of experience yes
[24/1/26, 16:08:57] ~ manav: But I refer you to my disagreement w the hyperprior argument a few days ago
[24/1/26, 16:10:06] ~ manav: FEP is a good possible answer to “why minds”
[24/1/26, 16:10:45] ~ manav: But the subject is existentially indifferent to the existence or non-existence of minds
[24/1/26, 16:11:34] Haziq KXHL: they’ve actually gone a bit more delulu since free energy tho and now they’re claiming minds/awarenesses live in this platonic space and get instantiated IRL. honestly great fun
[24/1/26, 16:11:50] ~ manav: Hardly less delulu than what I’m selling tbh
[24/1/26, 16:12:21] ~ manav: I respect anyone willing to accept that the world is much weirder than eliminativism would have you think
[24/1/26, 16:13:24] ~ manav: Anyway this has been super lively and stimulating but my train journey is up and I’m also cognitively spent so we’ll pick up another time
[24/1/26, 16:15:11] Haziq KXHL: absolutely, take care bro. always a pleasure hearing your thoughts. i’ll actually read kastrup and properly engage with transcendental unity of apperception instead of devolving into my usual strawmans next time 😭
[24/1/26, 16:16:06] ~ manav: I think you were pretty fair actually
[24/1/26, 16:16:10] ~ manav: But yeah I recommend

[24/1/26, 16:32:14] Haziq KXHL: *it’s in PNAS w only 1 citation for a reason mind you
[24/1/26, 20:28:17] Haziq KXHL: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.02.498577v1
hey @⁨~Anna Magpie⁩ finally went through this paper u asked abt cos what better way to spend sick leave right?

tl;dr they are saying selection minimises KL divergence between the current allele distribution and the ESS (as selection does tbh, this is the fundamental premise in evo game theory)

interesting bit is they show this is equivalent to selection minimising "regret" (which is a concept from online machine learning which these AI acolytes probably know better than us) but basically it means selection converges optimally fast to the ESS and doesnt loiter in unfit states. very cool very cool

pivoting from there to saying selection acquires information is just machine learning brainrot bc acquiring information in the sense of minimising KL divergence to ESS is hardly useful in an origin-of-life context where the information problem is about functional information or algorithmic information (Kolmogorov complexity etc). not reshuffling probabilities over an existing allele set 🙄
[24/1/26, 20:30:57] Haziq KXHL: ^ ^ we should still do the “mathematical evolution” journal club btw defo defo
[24/1/26, 20:57:34] Haziq KXHL: where are my manners, ESS = evolutionarily stable strategy i.e. the optimal allele distribution that once reached sticks

for anyone with an interest in evolution / natural selection, this is the biggest trompe-l'œil of neo-darwinism cos it perfectly explains how alleles get redistributed efficiently but never explains where the initial allele diversity came from

[24/1/26, 23:06:14] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: I love your vocabulary man!
[24/1/26, 23:09:41] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: I didn’t read the paper but does it say ‘acquire information’ as in somehow allele genes converge to the ESS or it’s more like stochastic and what’s left is probabilistically what’s more representative?
[24/1/26, 23:14:27] Haziq KXHL: bro is the only one acc taking my maths rant seriously, much appreciated!!
[24/1/26, 23:14:51] Haziq KXHL: yeah so the paper is kinda doing dumb wordplay. bcos KL divergence is defined in terms of Shannon information, they call convergence of the allele distribution to the ESS “acquiring information”
[24/1/26, 23:17:32] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Makes sense… I think…
[24/1/26, 23:17:48] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Also it’s loss function btw not regret minimisation in AI haha
[24/1/26, 23:19:43] Haziq KXHL: loss function in OG machine learning yeah but you guys have been cooking up this newer field called online machine learning?

there the objective shifts from minimising a loss function to minimising this new regret function
[24/1/26, 23:19:47] Haziq KXHL: https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~dbackus/GE_asset_pricing/computation/Pucci/Lec-24-v1.pdf
[24/1/26, 23:30:32] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Just read this (didn’t know the term before) - but the same thing, tho, right? It’s still just minimising loss in practice?
[24/1/26, 23:31:51] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Like the term is a more online ML-specific ‘wrapper’ than what’s being done being fundamentally different to loss minimisation?
[24/1/26, 23:35:05] Haziq KXHL: sorta yeah but not quite...

regret penalises both delta from the optimum *and* latency in achieving the optimum while loss function only penalises delta from the optimal

so you acc get different mathematical properties. loss function is what we’d call a state function (i.e. path independent) whereas regret is a process function (i.e. path dependent)
[24/1/26, 23:44:39] Haziq KXHL: btw wild how 20 years ago a p-val was elite maths for biology
now u walk into a bio lab and they hand u bishop PRML, hastie & tibshirani ESL, Sutton & Barto RL, goodfellow DL and that freaking impenetrable Ben-David + Shalev-Shwartz book
and then they tell u this is lvl 1 kiddo 🫠
like whatever happened to seeing squishy things under a microscope??
[24/1/26, 23:45:38] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Wait I don’t think that’s what it means when I read it… I can see they’re referring to time Big O and stuff but that’s auxiliary? I’ll properly read it sometime and get back but it feels like in this context it’s more like regret is defined as divergence from full info algo than what you said?
[24/1/26, 23:47:27] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Also, is it paper specific or a general term like loss?
‎[24/1/26, 23:49:18] Haziq KXHL: regret is literally defined as a cumulative functional over the trajectory, whereas loss is evaluated pointwise on the state ‎image omitted
[24/1/26, 23:50:09] Haziq KXHL: it's a general term within the specific field of "online machine learning"
[24/1/26, 23:53:13] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Noo that’s regret at time T.
It says regret is just the delta between ideal vs what we got. It at time T is what you say. ‎<This message was edited>
[24/1/26, 23:54:41] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Long day soo I’ll re-read it again but I def think this is a more right interpretation at this point in time (pun intended, haha!)
[24/1/26, 23:55:17] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: (And yeah all days in past forever years have been ‘long’ 😭)
‎[24/1/26, 23:57:34] Haziq KXHL: ‘just the delta between ideal vs what we got’ would be a point wise difference like abv. in the regret formula there is a summation over time steps (path integral) ‎image omitted

[25/1/26, 00:09:53] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Right got it makes sense
[25/1/26, 00:10:30] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Regret itself is the delta but online ML uses cumulative got it
[25/1/26, 00:10:44] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: And the whole process is called regret minimisation
[25/1/26, 00:10:58] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Whereas loss is just point wise
[25/1/26, 00:11:35] Haziq KXHL: yessss spot on!!! online machine learning is a separate field purely because path dependence leads to different mathematical properties

ERM / PAC generalisation theorems are about minimising final loss of a hypothesis. gradient descent convergence theorems bound f(theta_T) − f(theta*). none of that even makes sense in adversarial online settings

meanwhile no-regret theorems, Zinkevich-style O(sqrt(T)) regret bounds, lower bounds like R_T = Omega(sqrt(T)) and results where you get vanishing regret without convergence are all about cumulative behaviour over time
[25/1/26, 00:11:56] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: wtf how did you type that so fast 😂
[25/1/26, 00:12:07] Haziq KXHL: i had it typed already lol
[25/1/26, 00:12:11] Haziq KXHL: also 100wpm
[25/1/26, 00:12:16] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Makes sense 😂
[25/1/26, 00:12:22] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Damn my best is 75 I think
[25/1/26, 00:12:59] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: But in practice/production tho we only do loss tho cuz we don’t have the actual to do the delta?
[25/1/26, 00:13:08] Haziq KXHL: this is the sorta nonsense they teach in that book Ben-David + Shalev-Shwartz lol
[25/1/26, 00:14:00] Haziq KXHL: you minimise loss online, you analyse performance via regret. it’s like backtesting
[25/1/26, 00:14:13] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Ahhh right…
[25/1/26, 00:15:43] Haziq KXHL: regret is useful as a theoretical tool because it tells us which algorithms are optimal in an online learning context
[25/1/26, 00:15:43] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: That’s why I was wondering. Like the regret the way you explained didn’t make sense for non-deterministic (you’d know regret for prisoners dilemma but not for say YouTube content recommendations beforehand). Soo in that it’s effectively only loss/what we can do is loss. Right when you bring in backtesting it adds up.
[25/1/26, 00:16:05] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Yupp makes sense! This snaps into place for us…
[25/1/26, 00:16:31] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Most cerebral 12am convo. I think you’re progressively ruining my ability to get dates too 🤣
[25/1/26, 00:17:44] Haziq KXHL: but fr theres just so much math to learn man, its so hard to keep up like they never warned us abt this 😖
[25/1/26, 00:19:26] Haziq KXHL: we have this russian theoreticl physicist guy at the womens health dept researching "the fractal geometry of placental nutrient distribution networks" like what the hell??
[25/1/26, 00:21:14] ~ Elma : Dayum
[25/1/26, 00:21:21] ~ Elma : Guys should I drink coffee
[25/1/26, 00:21:35] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Red wine >>>
[25/1/26, 00:21:43] ~ Elma : Oh!
[25/1/26, 00:21:49] Haziq KXHL: 2 x double espresso shot
[25/1/26, 00:22:08] ~ Elma : Indont own an espresso machine yet 😩
[25/1/26, 00:22:15] ~ Elma : I only need 2 more hours of work
[25/1/26, 00:22:26] ~ Elma : But I wanna sleep after and not stay awake
[25/1/26, 00:22:36] ~ Elma : No can do
[25/1/26, 00:22:37] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: I think you’re doing alright haha! But yess it’s so fun!
[25/1/26, 00:22:53] ~ Elma : What are u both studying?
[25/1/26, 00:23:08] Haziq KXHL: like rn or in general?
[25/1/26, 00:23:18] ~ Elma : Both
[25/1/26, 00:23:23] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: I was just practicing for coding interviews…
[25/1/26, 00:23:36] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: That’s right now 😂
[25/1/26, 00:23:58] ~ Elma : I thought u were employed tuhan 😩
[25/1/26, 00:23:59] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: I just finished MSc analytics (and three other bachelors for fun 💀)
[25/1/26, 00:24:06] ~ Elma : Oh wow
[25/1/26, 00:24:13] ~ Elma : That’s what you’ve been doing fairs
[25/1/26, 00:24:19] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: I am. But need to stay sharp for next ;)
[25/1/26, 00:24:32] ~ Elma : Wjere do u have the time??
[25/1/26, 00:25:08] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: When you first-principle and vectorise content it’s easy lol!
[25/1/26, 00:25:49] Haziq KXHL: i study neuroscience & organic chemistry at UCL and undergrad researcher in few labs (institute for womens health and stanford bioengineering)
researchwise: im a classical biologist / field ecologist (means i used to track tigers on foot) trying to become a mathematician
[25/1/26, 00:26:29] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: The man the myth the legend
[25/1/26, 00:27:14] Haziq KXHL: 3 bachelors 😵‍💫 leave some for us man
[25/1/26, 00:28:14] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Hahaha
[25/1/26, 00:31:15] ~ Elma : Awe nice my friend did this exact course I think
[25/1/26, 00:31:20] ~ Elma : Her names blessing
[25/1/26, 00:31:36] ~ Elma : Thinks shes in third year now tho but could’ve been in ur class
[25/1/26, 00:31:41] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: What are you studying btw?
[25/1/26, 00:31:44] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Or doing
[25/1/26, 00:32:07] ~ Elma : I’m not studying anything
[25/1/26, 00:32:20] ~ Elma : Acc never went to uni cos I did an apprenticeship at 18
[25/1/26, 00:32:21] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: …aha, and?
[25/1/26, 00:32:29] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: That’s smart tbh
[25/1/26, 00:32:33] ~ Elma : working on my startup full time
[25/1/26, 00:32:42] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Ohh right!
[25/1/26, 00:32:44] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: What’s it about?
[25/1/26, 00:32:55] ~ Elma : But spent 3 years working under some great ppl before I did my own thing
[25/1/26, 00:33:10] Haziq KXHL: consulting to founder pipeline is GOATed 🙌
[25/1/26, 00:33:21] ~ Elma : Classiccc
[25/1/26, 00:33:31] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: What’s your start-up aboutttt
[25/1/26, 00:34:26] ~ Elma : Help employers attract more apprentice talent through housing - relocation/mobility is a huge factor for talent not being able to access opportunities in the city
[25/1/26, 00:34:40] ~ Elma : The second pillar of the business is focused on talent retention
[25/1/26, 00:34:52] ~ Elma : Which is the social members club for apprentices/young professionals
[25/1/26, 00:35:08] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Interesting…
[25/1/26, 00:35:17] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Wdym thru housing?
[25/1/26, 00:35:20] ~ Elma : It’s a v v niche space but a hot market atm bc of how cooked the job market is for grads
[25/1/26, 00:35:31] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: 100%!
[25/1/26, 00:35:33] ~ Elma : There’s no housing for apprentices like their is for uni students
[25/1/26, 00:35:45] ~ Elma : So if u lived in Nepal
[25/1/26, 00:35:52] ~ Elma : And wanted to go uni in Cambridge
[25/1/26, 00:35:57] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Ofc but they get paid right so they can get a flat?
[25/1/26, 00:36:08] ~ Elma : You could do that easily bc Cambridge have accomodation
[25/1/26, 00:36:13] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Ofc
[25/1/26, 00:36:30] ~ Elma : And relocation isnt a barrier in that case for u
[25/1/26, 00:36:45] ~ Elma : Apprentices don’t have that hence housing
[25/1/26, 00:37:17] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Ofc but they can get a flat from the open market?
[25/1/26, 00:37:37] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Or wait do you like aggregate/build uni accom-like for appreciates?
[25/1/26, 00:37:37] ~ Elma : Yes but it’s not streamlined at all or if u live w students ur the only one paying council tax - completely diff lifestyle etc
[25/1/26, 00:37:51] ~ Elma : Yh they can but this isnt B2C
[25/1/26, 00:37:57] ~ Elma : Or D2C
[25/1/26, 00:37:57] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: *apprentice
[25/1/26, 00:38:09] ~ Elma : Not build we don’t own any assets
[25/1/26, 00:38:21] ~ Elma : I can’t leak property strategy here aha
[25/1/26, 00:38:30] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Haha no worries
[25/1/26, 00:38:37] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: But yup got it I think…
[25/1/26, 00:38:43] ~ Elma : But it took me montjs and montjs of failing and trying to get to a solid revenue model
[25/1/26, 00:38:50] ~ Elma : Tell me
[25/1/26, 00:38:55] ~ Elma : Delete it after
[25/1/26, 00:39:09] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Tell you what?
[25/1/26, 00:39:16] ~ Elma : That you got it
[25/1/26, 00:39:24] ~ Elma : Property strategy
[25/1/26, 00:39:31] ~ Elma : Without owning the asset etc
[25/1/26, 00:40:08] Haziq KXHL: lol meanwhile im over here casually throwing around Stanford biotech IP in the group chat like its confetti 😭
[25/1/26, 00:40:09] ~ Elma : Whered he go
[25/1/26, 00:40:18] ~ Elma : LOOOOOL
[25/1/26, 00:40:31] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: No like I think I got what you’re doing not the property strategy
[25/1/26, 00:40:34] ~ Elma : you’re a free bird it’s good
[25/1/26, 00:40:43] ~ Elma : Ohhh ok got you
[25/1/26, 00:40:59] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: I mean …we talk too much man 😂😂
[25/1/26, 00:41:15] ~ Elma : There’s huge shift in people wanting to do an apprenticeship but housing is a barrier in taking that option
[25/1/26, 00:41:30] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Makes senseee
[25/1/26, 00:41:59] ~ Elma : I think in a decades time it will be the first option rather than a degree on its own as top employers are now partnering with top unis all funded ‎<This message was edited>
[25/1/26, 00:42:46] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Maybeee but personally I’d always do a uni - the network and leverage is crazy
[25/1/26, 00:43:10] ~ Elma : The network at jp Morgan and pwc etc are from unis
[25/1/26, 00:43:13] ~ Elma : It’s the same
[25/1/26, 00:43:23] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Like I was randomly doing the value of a uni good job is like 2% of the EV of a uni
[25/1/26, 00:43:35] ~ Elma : My coworkers at pwc were valedictorians at top international unis
[25/1/26, 00:43:55] Haziq KXHL: im the sorta network u get from uni, clearly not worth it lol 🙅‍♂️
[25/1/26, 00:44:04] ~ Elma : JP Morgan partner with Exeter university so you get both worlds at the same time
[25/1/26, 00:44:38] ~ Elma : They’re called degree apprenticeships for context
[25/1/26, 00:44:44] Haziq KXHL: makes me lil bit sad tho, there will be no one left to study the peacocks and butterflies 😢
[25/1/26, 00:44:48] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: If your end game is a job then yes that network yup!
[25/1/26, 00:45:06] ~ Elma : Awe that’s true
[25/1/26, 00:45:22] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: But for more infinite games the breathe matters more and having bandwidth to explore leisurely
[25/1/26, 00:45:28] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Instead of an echo chamber
[25/1/26, 00:45:38] ~ Elma : Agreed
[25/1/26, 00:45:46] ~ Elma : Depends what ur goal is
[25/1/26, 00:45:59] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Thank you! Damn I love these people in this group so cerebral 😭
[25/1/26, 00:46:02] ~ Elma : Mine was to learn business on a real human level not theoretically
[25/1/26, 00:46:03] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: And open minded
[25/1/26, 00:46:19] Haziq KXHL: strategic self destruction w flair. any takers?
[25/1/26, 00:46:58] ~ Elma : I chose to work for these past few years bc you learn most by doing not studying or hypothesising outcomes
[25/1/26, 00:47:11] ~ Elma : Wait Wdym loool
[25/1/26, 00:47:18] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: This is a good take for most unis but top unis compresses a lot you can’t really synthesise at work in terms of breath. You can always double down on depth
[25/1/26, 00:48:02] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: (For the record I was working full time alongside the said degrees :))
[25/1/26, 00:48:16] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: And dating baddies but not the topic here 😂
[25/1/26, 00:48:47] Haziq KXHL: just the fact im making the most idiotic career choices and willingly going into fields w lil to no compensation 😭 ‎<This message was edited>
[25/1/26, 00:48:53] ~ Elma : Yh true it rlly depends on the field - like if ur going into AI research or quant then yeah get ur degree ygm but if u wanna be a founder you just gotta do the thing head first - and then hire the nerds but you don’t gotta be one
[25/1/26, 00:49:23] ~ Elma : Ohhh I see
[25/1/26, 00:49:30] ~ Elma : I think youll be fine
[25/1/26, 00:49:42] ~ Elma : What do u do for work?
[25/1/26, 00:50:11] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: I mean this graciously but it’s a very naive Andrew Tate take. If you look at CEOs of all highly valued companies they’re good at the core business!
[25/1/26, 00:50:48] ~ Elma : You just have to be good w people to get a job tbf but once again depends on the field
[25/1/26, 00:50:49] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Now data science/AI but before loads of areas in tech, finance, education and media (TV ;))
[25/1/26, 00:51:14] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: And went to elite unis 😅
[25/1/26, 00:51:51] Haziq KXHL: elon isn’t a good engineer by any measure. i think “founder-stuff” is an orthogonal axis to technical aptitude
[25/1/26, 00:52:21] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Wdym he isn’t?
[25/1/26, 00:53:46] Haziq KXHL: he likes to think he is but lol it’s just posturing, stark contrast from the bona fide technical talent we see at imperial/UCL etc.
[25/1/26, 00:54:15] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: I’m sure he’s not the best engineer ever but he’s good at it lol
[25/1/26, 00:54:31] ~ Elma : I see where you’re coming from but I don’t think it’s naive if it’s true - also a successful founder doesnt always have to be measured by the best in the game - for example take Brian Chesky he wasn’t in the property world beforehand but did excellent with airbnb I’m sure there are many more examples but I do agree the data would say founder market fit is necessary
[25/1/26, 00:54:34] Haziq KXHL: and these guys aren’t great founders so that’s what i mean by these two things being orthogonal axes
[25/1/26, 00:55:17] ~ Elma : Also it’s a v VC way of looking at founders
[25/1/26, 00:55:42] Haziq KXHL: unlike bill gates or larry page, he didn’t build his business on his engineering prowess
[25/1/26, 00:55:44] ~ Elma : They obsess over founder market fit too much imo when sometimes it’s acc tje right hire and team that made the business what it is
[25/1/26, 00:55:53] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Statistically top conforms with what I said but obv there are outliers and and I’d agree with you lesser thresholds it’s prolly inversely correlated
[25/1/26, 00:56:10] ~ Elma : I’m gna acc research this
[25/1/26, 00:56:30] ~ Elma : I don’t think the folks who created Google were masters in their space
[25/1/26, 00:56:45] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Bro they went to Stanford 😭
[25/1/26, 00:57:10] ~ Elma : Well u can go Stanford but that not be the reason ur company is successful 🤣
[25/1/26, 00:57:30] ~ Elma : Not every top uni student is gna be an excellent founder it’s just one metric
[25/1/26, 00:57:46] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: That’s literally their uni research and got introduced to first funding thru uni professor. You took the worst canonical example 😂😂
[25/1/26, 00:58:02] Haziq KXHL: yeah it’s sorta a clickbait nowadays “all top CEOs are engineering grads” but IRL probably tech biased sampling
[25/1/26, 00:58:11] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Obviously! I’d argue most won’t even. But the best are around the top.
[25/1/26, 00:59:15] Haziq KXHL: partly true since tech is in fact the most lucrative field but a gross overgeneralisation if u apply it to real estate and other traditional industries
[25/1/26, 01:00:01] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: You’re mixing billionaires with millionaires that’s a huge difference
[25/1/26, 01:00:26] Haziq KXHL: as we socialists usually do 😭
[25/1/26, 01:00:27] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Anywayyy research/tech driven topics were more fun should stick to that 😂
[25/1/26, 01:00:45] ~ Elma : I meant my point generally not just Google but I’m sure so many have failed even if they went to the uni - there’s a VC fund called EP 1 here in london and they focus more on founder characteristics that create a successful founder - I think that’s a more reliable way to measure success rather than just academics ofc you need a mix but who the actual founder is and why they operate in such a way seems to always be more a consistent factor of success
[25/1/26, 01:01:33] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Ofcc that’s your pov. But what I said is statistically true :)
[25/1/26, 01:01:40] ~ Elma : Yh fairs
[25/1/26, 01:01:53] ~ Elma : It’s a v VC way of seeing the world
[25/1/26, 01:01:58] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: And it’s not the academics per se I’d agree with you it’s sometimes inversely correlated even
[25/1/26, 01:02:07] ~ Elma : Data driven over anything else
[25/1/26, 01:02:15] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: It’s more about having proof/track record
[25/1/26, 01:02:31] ~ Elma : Yh and deep understanding in the space
[25/1/26, 01:02:31] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Because it’s high variance if not
[25/1/26, 01:02:46] ~ Elma : But the founders of lawhive
[25/1/26, 01:02:51] ~ Elma : None were lawyers lol
[25/1/26, 01:02:58] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: And the amount of variables that goes into it the risk is ridiculous to just invest on vibes 😂
[25/1/26, 01:03:14] ~ Elma : I worked w all 3 founders they’re good engineers but not out of this world
[25/1/26, 01:03:33] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Anywayyy moving on…
[25/1/26, 01:03:38] Haziq KXHL: i find the level of R&D in corporate to be quite lacking actually, always a decade behind except in AI where they are leading. but AI is not theoretically interesting for the most part. 99% of it is ad hoc tweaking and messing abt and calling it research 🙄
[25/1/26, 01:03:40] ~ Elma : Yh fairs if it’s VC grade that’s a given
[25/1/26, 01:03:47] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: It’s so cool you did Pwc and doing your own thing now 👏
[25/1/26, 01:03:59] ~ Elma : The random glaze
[25/1/26, 01:04:09] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: No fr
[25/1/26, 01:04:20] ~ Elma : I’m surprised you find pwc cool
[25/1/26, 01:04:21] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: To end it on a good note 😂
[25/1/26, 01:04:29] ~ Elma : It’s not that hard to get into but yh
[25/1/26, 01:04:31] Haziq KXHL: be nice!!
[25/1/26, 01:04:33] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Why not? 😂
[25/1/26, 01:04:40] ~ Elma : Why not whay
[25/1/26, 01:05:13] ~ Elma : Oh why it’s not hard to get into
[25/1/26, 01:05:18] ~ Elma : Cos it’s just problem solving
[25/1/26, 01:05:22] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: 100%! I did this thought leadership forum - question a - will you think AI will disrupt your work idk say 90% said yes
Question b- will you adopt ai - 20% 😂😂
[25/1/26, 01:05:24] ~ Elma : And consulting is ppl driven
[25/1/26, 01:05:36] Haziq KXHL: Pwc is like the dream company for all my friends in the audit / consulting pipeline so obviously we’re impressed!!
[25/1/26, 01:05:57] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Makes sense! But I’m guessing it’s also very hard to prove you’re good at it as opposed to tech so yup 💯
[25/1/26, 01:06:04] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Like tech it’s objective
[25/1/26, 01:06:10] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: So it’s hard to be chosen
[25/1/26, 01:06:12] ~ Elma : It’s the dream cos everyones been brainwashed
[25/1/26, 01:06:17] ~ Elma : But I appreciate it
[25/1/26, 01:06:20] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: *easier
[25/1/26, 01:06:30] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: So this is harder I’m guessing?
[25/1/26, 01:06:33] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Haha
[25/1/26, 01:06:47] ~ Elma : Well ofc being a founder is harder than having a job don’t be silly
[25/1/26, 01:07:15] ~ Elma : Having good social skills is v easy to see
[25/1/26, 01:07:16] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: You’re so salty today 😂
[25/1/26, 01:07:33] ~ Elma : That’s why in final rounds the person who get the offer sticks out
[25/1/26, 01:07:36] ~ Elma : LOL
[25/1/26, 01:07:58] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: @⁨Haziq KXHL⁩ is more fun when we disagree 😭
[25/1/26, 01:07:59] ~ Elma : I think I just hate vcs I’m turning into haziq
[25/1/26, 01:08:12] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Be like him 😂😭
[25/1/26, 01:08:14] ~ Elma : Yh hes a good sport
[25/1/26, 01:08:20] ~ Elma : Never!
[25/1/26, 01:08:21] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Best!
[25/1/26, 01:08:24] Haziq KXHL: omg u sound like @⁨~samia 💗🌸⁩ now lol, pls don’t expect sympathy for landing a prestigious / cushy consulting job which ppl would sell a kidney for while some of us are in cursed fields like women’s health research w 0 funding 😭
[25/1/26, 01:09:12] ~ Elma : Okkk true we’re sorry it’s a privilege for sure but ask the insiders how they got it and youll feel silly abt how it’s acc not hard
[25/1/26, 01:09:28] ~ Elma : Getting a job is mainly charisma and competence
[25/1/26, 01:09:36] ~ Elma : That’s what the big firms look for
[25/1/26, 01:09:56] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: It’s not cognitively hard but it has a very high selection bias
[25/1/26, 01:09:56] ~ Elma : I passed the aptitude tests and final rounds cos I scored well on those
[25/1/26, 01:10:14] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Which makes it statistically hard
[25/1/26, 01:10:16] ~ Elma : And exceedingly better than the rest of the uk ofc but you can prep for the tests
[25/1/26, 01:10:25] ~ Elma : Yh agreed
[25/1/26, 01:10:41] ~ Elma : You just need to know what they’re looking for
[25/1/26, 01:10:45] ~ Elma : I think ppl go in blind
[25/1/26, 01:10:58] Haziq KXHL: pls tell me what the third thing is cos i got neither. if “sweet disposition” is on the list then i might have a decent shot 😌
[25/1/26, 01:11:03] ~ Elma : Lowkey I winged my tests but we’re not gna use me as data lol
[25/1/26, 01:11:13] ~ Elma : It might be 😩
[25/1/26, 01:11:35] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: I mean you can do McK
[25/1/26, 01:11:52] ~ Elma : They also love leaders / slightly cutthroat in character
[25/1/26, 01:12:02] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Their test (McK solve) was a lot easier than uni academics 😅
[25/1/26, 01:12:03] ~ Elma : You kinda have to be ruthless in final rounds
[25/1/26, 01:12:07] ~ Elma : But in a sweet way
[25/1/26, 01:12:16] ~ Elma : Yh I’m not surprised at all
[25/1/26, 01:12:30] ~ Elma : Once again they’re more so focused on the ppl side I’d say
[25/1/26, 01:12:50] ~ Elma : And problem solving which is where all the case prep comes in and how u think/talk etc
[25/1/26, 01:13:03] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: McK focuses on structured thinking but again that’s what we literally do in every argument here 😂
[25/1/26, 01:13:11] ~ Elma : Litch
[25/1/26, 01:13:11] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: @⁨Haziq KXHL⁩ 🙌
[25/1/26, 01:13:14] Haziq KXHL: McK: tell me abt yourself 
Me: so regarding capitalism…
[25/1/26, 01:13:39] ~ Elma : All of consulting is structured thibking but also you could be a structured thinker but seem shit infront of clients
[25/1/26, 01:13:55] ~ Elma : Hence why having a good social personality is important for the job
[25/1/26, 01:14:05] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Ofc 100%!
[25/1/26, 01:14:25] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Anyway I need to sleep wow this is the longest I’ve held my phone in ages 😂
[25/1/26, 01:14:30] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Since 2019 I think
[25/1/26, 01:14:37] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Should quit this group this is a toxic habit
[25/1/26, 01:14:37] ~ Elma : 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[25/1/26, 01:14:45] ~ Elma : Just to debate
[25/1/26, 01:14:47] Haziq KXHL: so we just gotta like really good at gaslighting the client then? sounds manageable…
[25/1/26, 01:14:49] ~ Elma : Nooooo
[25/1/26, 01:14:54] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Extrovert problems 😂
[25/1/26, 01:15:02] ~ Elma : I meant no to tuhan quitting
[25/1/26, 01:15:02] Haziq KXHL: KXHL is one helluva drug
[25/1/26, 01:15:05] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Corporate rizz
[25/1/26, 01:15:11] ~ Elma : It’s good we’re all different
[25/1/26, 01:15:18] ~ Elma : Perhaps
[25/1/26, 01:15:24] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: No I was joking it’s cerebral haha
[25/1/26, 01:15:27] ~ Elma : Tuhan ur an extrovert?
[25/1/26, 01:15:40] ~ Elma : Guys do I give off introvert
[25/1/26, 01:15:52] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Wait that wasn’t obvious?
[25/1/26, 01:15:59] ~ Elma : No
[25/1/26, 01:16:02] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Wow

[25/1/26, 01:16:52] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Good at both omg
[25/1/26, 01:16:57] ~ Elma : Omg
[25/1/26, 01:17:00] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: I feel like I betrayed myself
[25/1/26, 01:17:01] Haziq KXHL: u sound like you’ve seen too much nonsense already and don’t have time for more
[25/1/26, 01:17:02] ~ Elma : Yi Hien wake up!!!

[25/1/26, 01:20:11] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Wow 😂

[25/1/26, 01:20:19] ~ Elma : Good analysis
[25/1/26, 01:20:31] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: What? 😂
[25/1/26, 01:20:42] Haziq KXHL: u need a scam personality test to tell u the guy who did his undergrad at 13 is smart?? 😭
[25/1/26, 01:21:06] ~ Elma : it’s called gaslighting haziq x
[25/1/26, 01:21:20] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Also like ENTP has nothing to do with smartness tbh
[25/1/26, 01:21:27] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: It’s more about arrogance and confidence 😂
[25/1/26, 01:21:28] Haziq KXHL: omg forgot u were a consultant
[25/1/26, 01:21:34] ~ Elma : Didnt say it was

[25/1/26, 01:24:39] ~ Elma : I agree
[25/1/26, 01:25:10] ~ Elma : I don’t live by it also personality is too nuanced and ur worldview could change etc
[25/1/26, 01:25:15] ~ Elma : Guys do I seem selfish
[25/1/26, 01:25:33] ~ Elma : Here he comes

[25/1/26, 01:27:02] ~ Elma : Oh fairs
[25/1/26, 01:27:05] Haziq KXHL: true, KXHL is a 
 democratic socialist institution

[25/1/26, 01:27:19] ~ Elma : agreed
[25/1/26, 01:27:36] ~ Elma : Feels like it’s owned and run by tuhan atm tho
[25/1/26, 01:27:50] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: No like the uni vs not chat with you felt adversarial than collaborative but no biggie
[25/1/26, 01:27:59] Haziq KXHL: bros got that main character energy

[25/1/26, 01:29:23] Haziq KXHL: as long as it doesn’t devolve into a parking lot fight
[25/1/26, 01:29:30] ~ Elma : Bro said top unis and went to Coventry
[25/1/26, 01:29:53] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Suree but it’s a bit meh meh when you argue statistics with anecdotals

[25/1/26, 01:31:42] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: …?
[25/1/26, 01:31:57] Haziq KXHL: i mean there’s no mistake there, pls don’t feel the need to justify it, it’s wildly impressive in any case, few other ppl have done that
[25/1/26, 01:32:13] ~ Elma : I’m just saying cos u were using ur academics at “top unis” as ur credibility argument
[25/1/26, 01:32:39] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Haha it’s long term makes sense after you scaffold which I’ve not but life would’ve been smoother with elite uni bachelors haha!

[25/1/26, 01:33:58] ~ Elma : Yes we know thank you for that
[25/1/26, 01:34:07] ~ Elma : That’s like saying the sky is blue

[25/1/26, 01:36:15] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Honestly it’s just confirmation bias at this point from your end

[25/1/26, 09:02:16] ~ samia 💗🌸: Lollll
[25/1/26, 09:18:47] Yi Hein: Introducing ChatKXHL! Our first KXHL LLM model, _kxhl-1_.

Try it out here:
https://chat.kxhacklab.com

(all non-green bubble messages are generated by the model)

this is a 3M parameter, GPT based decoder only model. 

With this model, we will be creating alternate universes of KXHL chats run by different models.

Every week, I will be releasing a new KXHL model with different architectural experiments.
[25/1/26, 09:21:36] Yi Hein: the model is still pretty bad at english, but will get better with future versions
[25/1/26, 09:29:23] Haziq KXHL: bro really trained an LLM exclusively to roast our yapping 💀
‎[25/1/26, 09:29:58] Haziq KXHL: i rate it, sounds like something i would say tbh ‎image omitted
[25/1/26, 09:30:16] Haziq KXHL: GhostGPT when??

[25/1/26, 15:29:57] Haziq KXHL: my social media incompetence keeps me a full generation behind on trends. i was babysitting my nieces and only realised way too late their inside joke was that i didn’t understand the significance of 67. istg gen alpha makes us look like angels
[25/1/26, 15:32:41] Haziq KXHL: i laughed back at them for not understanding the nuance and subtext of finding nemo so honestly i think i won
[25/1/26, 16:36:57] Haziq KXHL: @⁨Eli KXHL⁩ hellllooooo hope this is Eli?? not 100% sure cos u dont have a display name but had a question for you since u work on the theoretical side of machine learning.

we were discussing regret functions from the online ML literature earlier and i was wondering why the process function / path integral formalisms from non equilibrium statistical mechanics havent really been used here especially when so many other analogies from physics are borrowed.

ofc the merit of any analogy comes from new insights or predictions that fall out of it. i remember us talking about how Le Cun’s energy based formulation of deep learning is mostly aesthetic lol. but here is one thing that seems to fall out pretty immediately from regret x thermo.

in a closed thermodynamic system, there is a minimum energy dissipation cost incurred purely through entropy production (meaning irreversibility) even as the system tends towards a minimum free energy state.

by analogy, it seems like there should be a minimum regret cost incurred purely through the irreversibility of the learning process itself. this feels new because we usually think of regret as coming from bad proxy losses or bad data but this is due to entropy production of the learning dynamics itself. with aggressive optimisers,, the learning trajectory becomes irreversible due to sensitive dependence on initial conditions or Lyapunov type effects etc etc
[25/1/26, 16:41:41] Haziq KXHL: @⁨Niv Ucl Builder⁩ who else is the computational learning theorist in this chat?? pls take me to your leader
[25/1/26, 16:58:03] Eli KXHL: Thats a genuinely interesting question i wish i had an answer to. not much literature seems to be covering this when i looked it up. The boring probable answer is its mostly because stat mech people ≠ regret bounds folks and both are in their own worlds.
[25/1/26, 16:58:36] Eli KXHL: Been too submerged in pure maths lately to read on ml unfortunately
[25/1/26, 17:08:42] Haziq KXHL: fair fair that makes sense. honestly feels like there’s a physics prize up for grabs here if hinton got one for the boltzmann machine lol. surely learning theorists and thermodynamicists should be talking to each other more than with the peacock feather theorist (me 😭)
[25/1/26, 17:11:50] Haziq KXHL: respect the hard work, hope you’ve been keeping well & hope we’ll see you at KXHL eventually!! also curious what side of maths has been keeping you busy. we’re always nosy about what KXHL ppl are up to 😁

[25/1/26, 17:22:59] Eli KXHL: Il try to come soon ! Im all over atm, stuff like (dif geo, functional analysis, stochastic analysis, variational PDEs …)
[25/1/26, 17:23:31] Eli KXHL: These are great, did a info sesh for the oxford one, extremely competitive tho
[25/1/26, 17:23:55] Eli KXHL: Like less than 10 people intake for >500 applicants
[25/1/26, 17:24:30] Eli KXHL: Add to it all the ml people who were gonna apply to the us this year
[25/1/26, 17:24:40] Eli KXHL: Rough time to be applying for a phd
[25/1/26, 17:24:50] Haziq KXHL: yeah i’ve heard, my sister got into one and apparently the average applicant had like 3 masters 💀
[25/1/26, 17:25:29] Eli KXHL: Damn.
[25/1/26, 17:26:29] Haziq KXHL: that’s really cool. random q but is there any interesting work where non linear dynamical systems meet differential geometry? ik it sounds weird but like ricci flows with chaos
[25/1/26, 17:28:23] Haziq KXHL: ugh USA phds are long enough to be considered posthumous awards
[25/1/26, 17:30:50] Haziq KXHL: safety net tho is germany where a phd isn’t really treated as a merit based award, it’s more like phd students are the quanta of research labour so they’re not selecting for highest undergrad achievers etc
most programmes ive seen only ask for a 3rd class honours lol
[25/1/26, 17:35:16] Eli KXHL: A lot actually
[25/1/26, 17:35:46] Eli KXHL: Type up villani he wrote a lot on this
[25/1/26, 17:36:58] Eli KXHL: He happened to be one of my fav French politicians also and hes a mathematician (fields medal 2010)
[25/1/26, 17:39:51] Haziq KXHL: ofc ofc i’m quite familiar with his work on optimal transport since it’s become a bit of a staple tool in modern biology. and yeah we were all rooting for mayor villani for paris 😁
[25/1/26, 18:24:01] Haziq KXHL: btw actually curious if ppl still build stuff around here lol 😆. @⁨Yi Hein⁩ ofc but what are the rest of y’all up to?? cos ngl KXHL is starting to look less like a hack club and more like princeton IAS day by day so pls someone save our reputation 🙏
[25/1/26, 18:26:27] Haziq KXHL: @⁨Hera KXHL⁩ when are we taking Script Reader™️ to the accelerators? are we seed round curious yet?
[25/1/26, 18:48:13] Haziq KXHL: alternatively we sell your script reader + my alex and taylor story written by the spirit of jorge luis borges in full romantic delulu mode to A24 studios as a package deal. broke enough to accept 99-1 profit sharing if you throw in a cookie with my cut and a whole slide with only my name in comic sans in the opening credits

[25/1/26, 20:10:01] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Hard work beats talent but when talent work hards invincible - same analogy. Talent here is objective/plan/instituitnal bits
[25/1/26, 20:13:04] Haziq KXHL: ngl yi hein’s drunk texting AI version of me is probably more coherent 🫠
[25/1/26, 21:06:32] ~ samia 💗🌸: I wonder what would Yi Hein would be like drunk 🤔💭
[25/1/26, 21:07:26] Haziq KXHL: how dare you?! bro is stone cold sober, always has been. don’t slander!!
[25/1/26, 21:08:12] Haziq KXHL: *just joking btw, gosh ppl keep getting triggered by my jokes
[25/1/26, 21:08:31] Haziq KXHL: **but he does in fact not drink fyi
[25/1/26, 21:09:20] Haziq KXHL: ** * i wonder why tho 🤔 especially when i have such a sweet disposition 🥰
[25/1/26, 21:14:05] Haziq KXHL: ** * * lol at this point it’s just me, Yi Hein and the Christian women’s union single handedly propping up the temperance movement 😭
[25/1/26, 23:23:56] Yi Hein: yes now that i have unlocked the transformer tech tree, there are loads of interesting experiments i’m gonna try out
[25/1/26, 23:25:49] Yi Hein: one of which is to integrate an accessory modern hopfield network as a form of “short-term” detailed knowledge storage for the model. it has 2 trainable parameters (the weight update rule threshold), which we can propagate gradients from the transformer through
[25/1/26, 23:26:48] Yi Hein: i’m arguing here that you don’t need a completely different objective function, but you can augment the existing models
[25/1/26, 23:31:13] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Any chance toy might be doing a video walkthrough of what you did so far for this?
[25/1/26, 23:33:48] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: *you
[25/1/26, 23:34:18] Yi Hein: yeah ofc only if i manage to get it to work
[25/1/26, 23:34:47] Yi Hein: for the transformer i’ve just follow karpathy’s tutorials
[25/1/26, 23:42:23] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Looking forward to it 🙌
[25/1/26, 23:44:13] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Which one’s this? I started reading HuggingFace’s. This is taking me forever.
This btw, if you like: https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceTB/smol-training-playbook
[26/1/26, 05:59:23] Haziq KXHL: huge difference between a _different_ objective function and the _objective-less_ training paradigm they are proposing mind you…
[26/1/26, 06:02:29] Haziq KXHL: also let’s just keep doing what we’ve been doing so far (tweaking architecture) isn’t much of an argument. they are proposing interesting new theory here. all our scaling just seems to be leading to spaghetti internal representations
[26/1/26, 06:08:55] Haziq KXHL: when Thomas Serre published (recently, 2025) showing that AI object recognition has diverged from human primary vision, what they meant was AI has gained the spaghetti representations needed to overfit the biased datasets we use for training whereas human internal representations can robustly handle “ecological” IRL data
[26/1/26, 06:15:02] Haziq KXHL: sorry im sure ppl have done similar work in natural language but im more familiar with the computer vision cos neuro dept gives us a zillion vision classes and exactly 1 lecture saying Broca’s area in the front and wernicke’s area is in the back 😭

lil bit dated research presentation from MIT CBMM showing the same thing
[26/1/26, 06:19:24] Haziq KXHL: the field of xAI really revealed just how heuristic and fragile 🕸️ LLM internal representations and reasoning structure is. see anthropic’s work: https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/biology.html#dives-addition

[26/1/26, 06:20:14] Haziq KXHL: *by xAI i mean explainable AI which is a research field within machine learning, not Elon’s depraved AI project
[26/1/26, 06:26:08] Haziq KXHL: lowkey think there’s deep theory lurking beneath their findings hence my interest in regret functions and non-equilibrium thermodynamics (cos they talk abt path dependence through parameter space), i sent a 2a.m. email explaining this to the authors 😭 pls see below: ‎<This message was edited>

[26/1/26, 12:35:56] Haziq KXHL: Feel free to DM @⁨Yi Hein⁩ to fix a date, we usually do misc events outside of our usual hacking sessions
[26/1/26, 12:59:26] Haziq KXHL: Hi @⁨~Odira⁩, tysm for joining!! 
KXHL is a part hack club part theoretical neuroscience interest group originally from UCL but now we have a quite broad membership 
https://kxhacklab.com/
[26/1/26, 12:59:49] ~ Odira: Hi, my name’s Odira; I’m a PhD student in Bioengineering at Imperial College London focusing on Neural Engineering (brain stimulation for tremor control, signal analysis, computational modelling which I haven’t done before but will do later in the PhD) ‎<This message was edited>
[26/1/26, 12:59:54] ~ Odira: Thanks for having me
[26/1/26, 13:06:25] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Hello Odira 👋
[26/1/26, 13:06:49] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Honestly you talk like 90% of the time sometimes it feels like a DM with you with other people watching 😂😂
[26/1/26, 13:07:38] ~ Odira: I came here because bro was speaking quantum-ese in a different chat 😭😂
[26/1/26, 13:07:44] Haziq KXHL: for context guys we were discussing whether apparent quantum-like structure in neural / cognitive models is actually doing explanatory work, and @⁨~Odira⁩ asked whether higher order neuronal function might just _resemble_ quantum processes rather than literally being quantum
[26/1/26, 13:08:07] Haziq KXHL: i think the main thing is that the probabilistic / information theoretic apparatus we already use is just… really well suited to modelling cognition, without needing the extra mathematical structure of actual quantum mechanics like hilbert spaces etc
[26/1/26, 13:08:29] Haziq KXHL: neural systems storing uncertainty, distributions, weighted states etc doesnt imply a quantum substrate, it just means probability theory is doing its job. classical stochastic dynamics already gets you very far here
[26/1/26, 13:09:14] Haziq KXHL: there is one pretty obvious functional benefit if neural computation genuinely did resemble quantum computation which is that a brain in a machine would be wildly efficient to simulate on quantum hardware. but thats more of a computational convenience than evidence about how the brain actually works
[26/1/26, 13:09:53] ~ Carmen : Yes!
[26/1/26, 13:10:36] Haziq KXHL: what Orch-OR is really chasing is something different, not “quantum-like maths is useful” but quantum physics enabling fundamentally new biological interventions. stuff like em fields, collapse dynamics, non classical causal mechanisms
[26/1/26, 13:11:18] ~ Odira: Would there be any metabolic benefit? Like, storing all the possible states a system can occupy with all these degrees of freedom in this tiny lump of flesh is still a marvel to me… are probabilistic frameworks enough to explain that already? I’m not on the computational/information-theoretic side of neuro yet so that’s why I’m asking
[26/1/26, 13:12:10] Haziq KXHL: i have a soft spot for this cos i tried a similar experiment with projecting scRNA-seq data into hilbert space to develop quantum-native bioinformatics algorithms. can't say it was massively succesful 🫠
[26/1/26, 13:15:18] Haziq KXHL: thing is we already have a pretty solid theory for this in the form of population coding and neural manifolds

this is maybe a bit niche and i can already feel the other neuro ppl in here side eyeing me lol but im kind of an acolyte. the idea is that the brain isnt representing all possible states explicitly, its using low dimensional structure embedded in high dimensional neural activity

so you get this huge apparent representational capacity without paying the full metabolic or combinatorial cost. the efficiency comes from geometry, correlations and circuit level constraints rather than exotic physics

which is why imo theres no real need to bring quantum into this particular parking lot fight when we already have good circuit level theories that explain both the efficiency and the flexibility pretty well
[26/1/26, 13:16:03] Haziq KXHL: btw are u in the CDT BioDesign engineering programme cos that would be a crazy coincidence ngl
[26/1/26, 13:16:49] ~ Odira: Nope; just the Bioengineering program
[26/1/26, 13:19:05] ~ Odira: I think so too; why do we need to make neuroscience even harder if we are already doing a decent job at it

I guess people just wanna find new ways to find new things, and I guess for some people, that “explaining things pretty well” doesn’t suffice 🤷🏿‍♂️
[26/1/26, 13:21:04] ~ Odira: But yeah, until there’s any apparent benefit or increased accuracy to quantum-*like* representations of neural function compared to existing models, its hard to see the point in it all ‎<This message was edited>
[26/1/26, 13:21:25] Haziq KXHL: ngl a lot of Orch-OR feels less like “neuroscience needs this” and more like “free will got cooked by libet and we need physics to save it”

penrose is pretty open about wanting real indeterminacy and agency back in the picture and theres also some not-very-subtle eastern philosophy revival vibes

which is fine but thats a different project from explaining neural computation. more worldview repair than model repair tbh ‎<This message was edited>
[26/1/26, 13:22:31] ~ Odira: Idk who Orch-OR is but I hope he/she is doing well 🙂
[26/1/26, 13:23:01] ~ Odira: (Idk what Orch-OR is lemme read it)
[26/1/26, 13:23:46] ~ Odira: (Don’t blame me bruh I’m just a guy who likes shocking brains 🤷🏿‍♂️)
[26/1/26, 13:23:52] Haziq KXHL: *Orchestrated objective reduction
[26/1/26, 13:24:10] ~ Odira: Here he goes with that Quantum-ese again smh
[26/1/26, 13:24:24] Haziq KXHL: bro im the field ecologist i got no dog in this fight 😖
[26/1/26, 13:26:04] ~ manav: orch-OR is dumb asf
[26/1/26, 13:26:14] Haziq KXHL: i think closed loop DBS is really cool but just feel like it’s lacking the predictive control aspect cos the intervention is not coupled to any predictive theory of the brain. idk maybe that’s just UCL theoretical neuro brainrot speaking
[26/1/26, 13:26:16] ~ Odira: The whole “Free will got cooked by Libet” thing… idk I’d argue that true free will is VERY DIFFERENT to what we perceive as free will. So I’d argue that everyone is just debating perceived free will, not actual free will
[26/1/26, 13:27:08] ~ manav: probably the theory that is most devastated by the incompleteness thing i’m always going on about
[26/1/26, 13:27:38] ~ manav: circuit level grounding is more than sufficient for a relational/correspondence understanding of mental phenomena
[26/1/26, 13:27:48] Haziq KXHL: word 🔥
Professor Ponnekanti in the house
[26/1/26, 13:27:52] ~ Odira: My project isn’t CL-DBS; it’s dual-site phase specific transcranial alternating current stimulation

Trying to see if we can actually leave lasting after effects similar to STDP

In my head, depending on the efficacy, it would go towards reducing the need for closed-loop solutions but lemme ask my supervisor first lol
[26/1/26, 13:28:45] ~ manav: at least friston etc try to ground the subject in some sort of trans-empirical principle. microtubules is totally unforgivable
[26/1/26, 13:28:56] Haziq KXHL: 😭 didn’t know you needed supervisor sign off to have opinions at imperial
[26/1/26, 13:29:05] ~ Odira: You mean with the free energy principle and active inference?
[26/1/26, 13:29:15] ~ Odira: Opinions can’t be wrong but they can be INACCURATE
[26/1/26, 13:29:21] ~ Odira: People always forget that
[26/1/26, 13:29:51] ~ manav: yeah but i’m not straightforwardly an FEP endorser either
[26/1/26, 13:30:44] Haziq KXHL: Take cover @⁨~Odira⁩ ur about to be hit with Kant 😆
[26/1/26, 13:31:28] ~ manav: i’m more with Varela and Bitbol etc in that you can’t ever ground 1st person subjectivity in some empirical basis because subjectivity is the prerequisite to empiricism in the first place. But I also make the awareness/mind distinction so I think you can relationally ground mental activity in circuit terms
[26/1/26, 13:32:26] ~ Odira: Idk who Varela and Bitbol are but that “subjectivity is the prerequisite to empiricism” is interesting… elaborate
[26/1/26, 13:32:41] ~ manav: ok so you’re familiar with eliminativist attempts right
[26/1/26, 13:32:47] ~ Odira: No.
[26/1/26, 13:32:52] ~ manav: like dennett and 99.5% of neuroscientists
[26/1/26, 13:32:53] ~ Odira: I shock brain.
[26/1/26, 13:32:55] ~ Odira: That’s it.
[26/1/26, 13:32:58] ~ Odira: 🤷🏿‍♂️
[26/1/26, 13:33:52] ~ manav: so basically there’s a contingent of people who think that qualia don’t actually exist and the sum total of your inner life is just the electrical activity happening in your brain with the illusion of coherence or 'binding'
[26/1/26, 13:35:09] ~ Odira: Nah lemme stop joking; basically I studied Neuroscience at undergrad and Dual Masters but never really got into the “philosophy of science” side of things. But naturally as a curious person you start to have more questions about things and read theories here and there and not know what to believe. So words like eliminativist and what not I just wouldn’t have come across because I don’t often read arguments and debates about the state of neuroscience but I should
[26/1/26, 13:35:55] ~ Odira: Ok yes got that, some people think consciousness is an emergent property of systemic neural function got it ‎<This message was edited>
[26/1/26, 13:36:24] Haziq KXHL: *qualia = the first-person experience of something
not the facts, not the explanation, just how it feels in ur head
like red, pain or music hitting different for everyone
[26/1/26, 13:36:34] ~ manav: which seems fine on first blush but the issue is that the actual chain of reasoning here is:

i see reliable neural correlates of consciousness -> this deflates the need to posit anything except neural activity for conscious experiences -> therefore my subjective experience is illusory and only the brain activity is real
[26/1/26, 13:36:46] ~ Odira: Yeah that’s what I said shhhhh 👀👀👀👀
[26/1/26, 13:36:50] ~ manav: ok but how did dennett or anyone else access neural correlates of consciousness?
[26/1/26, 13:37:38] ~ Odira: I only just had breakfast bro idk what Dennett is on about
[26/1/26, 13:38:01] ~ manav: it’s through their first person experience of the world right? they experienced an MRI study or something. you can never access evidence outside of your subjective experience of the world
[26/1/26, 13:38:06] Haziq KXHL: just defining terms for ppl who are happily external to this cat and dog fight
[26/1/26, 13:38:14] ~ Odira: True
[26/1/26, 13:38:43] Haziq KXHL: *as in the cat and dog fight in the field, this GC is pacifist thankfully
[26/1/26, 13:38:44] ~ Odira: Haha I was joking; basically I didn’t want you to see that I grossly oversimplified Manav’s paragraph about qualia 😂
[26/1/26, 13:38:54] ~ Odira: To the point where technically what I said is wrong
[26/1/26, 13:39:16] ~ manav: So what this means is that theory that tries to deflate consciousness on the basis of empirical findings undermines the very faculty that gives validity to the empirical findings. What I mean by that is that evidence is always experienced

So if I’m like ‘actually consciousness is a composite of various neural processes with the illusion of coherence’ on the basis of seeing reliable NCCs I’ve now destabilised the medium through which empirical evidence (witnessing the NCCs, cognising their implications) arrives to me. It’s all sense data eventually, how can I trust that it isn’t nonsense with the illusion of coherence
[26/1/26, 13:39:28] ~ manav: Copying and pasting from an earlier message lmao don’t @ me haziq
[26/1/26, 13:40:16] ~ Odira: Brother that goes on to invalidate all of our life as we see it if that’s true, yes

What an interesting conundrum…
[26/1/26, 13:40:32] ~ manav: Yeah it’s deeply pessimistic but there’s a way out imo
[26/1/26, 13:41:05] ~ manav: Kant talks about something called the transcendental unity of apperception. This is just a really fancy way to describe ‘the fact that you are experiencing things at all'
[26/1/26, 13:41:45] ~ Odira: Neuroscientists love trying to sound smart
Like bro you do neuroscience, you don’t need to sound smart 😭 reel it in
[26/1/26, 13:42:02] ~ Odira: (I can make this joke because I am one)
[26/1/26, 13:42:16] Haziq KXHL: For a sec I was like… didn’t I already read this in a past life 😭
[26/1/26, 13:42:21] ~ manav: this is what we mean by the ‘subject’. it’s that basic state to which the world is disclosed. but this is the kicker: in the same way a water bottle is an ‘object’ to base awareness, your thoughts are also objects to your base awareness
[26/1/26, 13:43:06] ~ manav: what i mean by that is just that you can observe your thoughts
[26/1/26, 13:43:12] ~ manav: when you are happy you are aware that you are happy
[26/1/26, 13:43:14] ~ manav: etc etc
[26/1/26, 13:43:29] Haziq KXHL: no but there’s actual substance in philosophy tho 😭 istg this is not just word salad
[26/1/26, 13:43:32] ~ manav: so all of this stuff we call ‘mind’ is sort of in the same basic category as water bottles and brains
[26/1/26, 13:43:45] ~ manav: or at least it _could_ be, idk yet
[26/1/26, 13:44:14] ~ Odira: Oh no dw I agree haha I just hate how often times neuroscientists make the field inaccessible to onlookers by the language they choose
[26/1/26, 13:44:18] ~ manav: so what to take away from all this? basically anything that is an ‘object’ to your 1st person bare experience of the world is in principle empiricism-apt
[26/1/26, 13:44:28] ~ manav: you can measure and come to consensus etc
[26/1/26, 13:44:36] ~ Odira: Man this reminds me of when I debated what a soul might be against ChatGPT
[26/1/26, 13:45:47] ~ Odira: That sounds like something I used to say “our idea of what is objective truth is just consensus based on most supported evidence”
[26/1/26, 13:45:52] ~ manav: so if we distinguish between mind and awareness, as neuroscientists we can have 95% of our cake and eat it too. I think we can find neural bases for all mental activity including complex emotion but that 5% is totally inaccessible which is just the fact of experiencing itself
[26/1/26, 13:46:17] Haziq KXHL: my bro did NOT give you a free PhD-level philosophy seminar on a Monday afternoon for this to be compared to ChatGPT 😭
[26/1/26, 13:46:40] ~ Odira: I meant no insult by it at all
[26/1/26, 13:46:42] ~ manav: the reason this is a useful distinction is stuff like orch-or, hofstadter’s strange loop, like a solid 50% of what goes on at top metacognition labs etc is a total waste of time
[26/1/26, 13:46:52] ~ manav: none taken at all hahaha
[26/1/26, 13:47:30] ~ manav: you will never be able to ground the fact of experience, what is sometimes called ‘emergence’ and such by using scientific instrumentation because the fact of experience is a prerequisite to doing science or literally anything else
[26/1/26, 13:47:44] ~ Odira: So wait is this YOUR hypothesis now, yes?
[26/1/26, 13:47:52] ~ manav: yes this is my hypothesis
[26/1/26, 13:48:01] ~ manav: the ‘i think’ is my optimism
[26/1/26, 13:48:04] ~ Odira: Yeah that makes sense actually
[26/1/26, 13:48:10] Haziq KXHL: Hofstadter’s strange loop = when a system keeps talking about itself until self-awareness accidentally spawns
like thoughts thinking about thoughts
brain looks in the mirror too long and goes “oh damn that’s me”
[26/1/26, 13:48:17] ~ Odira: Yo where did they find this Manav dude bruh
[26/1/26, 13:48:34] Haziq KXHL: *reminder to @⁨~manav⁩ that not everyone reads the golden braid 😭
[26/1/26, 13:48:35] ~ manav: it could definitely be the case that mental states are still made up of something that isn’t measurable but there’s no reason to assume that lol
[26/1/26, 13:48:46] ~ manav: i’m so bad bro
[26/1/26, 13:48:54] ~ manav: we need to work on a better pitch
[26/1/26, 13:48:58] ~ manav: for this whole idea
[26/1/26, 13:49:04] Haziq KXHL: UCL philosophy dept and neuroscience dept had a baby
[26/1/26, 13:49:04] ~ manav: i’m pretty sure i’m gonna do phd on this actually
[26/1/26, 13:49:05] ~ Odira: What is a golden braid and why can’t I just go to the hairdressers
[26/1/26, 13:49:34] ~ Odira: Man I did my first portion of my Dual Masters at UCL and I was not invited to the baby shower wtf
[26/1/26, 13:49:54] ~ manav: when i eventually turn up to a kxhl lock in session i will try to present some empirically dignified way to test out what i’m proposing here
[26/1/26, 13:50:02] Haziq KXHL: 😭 Gödel, Escher, Bach: the eternal golden braid, book by computer scientist legend Hofstaeder
[26/1/26, 13:51:11] ~ Odira: I should’ve had my soul debate with Manav, in fact, I’m GOING to have it with Manav when I have time away from electrocuting brains yes
[26/1/26, 13:51:16] ~ manav: my current line of thought is to come up with circuit level accounts for states of compromise between self/other distinction, dissociation, etc
[26/1/26, 13:51:41] ~ manav: because we can demonstrate that states of self-disintegration are still _experienced_ per se
[26/1/26, 13:51:56] Haziq KXHL: Pls do come to our in person sessions!! Would be lovely to meet IRL
[26/1/26, 13:52:46] Niv Ucl Builder: cool stuff! i have an essential tremor (albeit mild) and was looking into TCDS earlier this year! ‎<This message was edited>
[26/1/26, 13:52:51] ~ Odira: Nah idk if I can handle Manav saying the word eliminativist out loud
[26/1/26, 13:53:32] Haziq KXHL: If we call it a neuroscience startup instead of an existential spiral, we get funding
[26/1/26, 13:53:46] Haziq KXHL: This is literally neuroscience x philosophy x AI bait, investors would eat it up
[26/1/26, 13:53:47] ~ manav: the reason this is meaningful is because it is an empirical question whether ipseity collapse and stuff like that is some additional circuit interfering with standard ego-generation or whether its a dysregulation in the OG ego generation circuit
[26/1/26, 13:53:54] ~ Odira: Nice to meet you! How did your search into tDCS go?
[26/1/26, 13:54:05] ~ manav: if it’s the latter then hey presto, awareness
[26/1/26, 13:54:20] ~ Odira: Brother who is oopsy-daisy; I mean, “ipseity”
[26/1/26, 13:54:35] ~ manav: sense of self
[26/1/26, 13:54:56] ~ manav: awareness that you are a single agent interacting with a distinct world
[26/1/26, 13:55:03] Haziq KXHL: ipseity = the I-ness of being you
not ur personality, not ur name just the default “this is happening to me” setting
the constant POV tag on ur existence
[26/1/26, 13:55:07] ~ Odira: I can help with this
[26/1/26, 13:55:25] ~ manav: you lose this in various kinds of psychosis and also a pretty rare family of left hemisphere strokes
[26/1/26, 13:55:37] ~ Odira: Also I am joking I would love to come IRL
[26/1/26, 13:56:17] ~ Odira: …I swear there is a simpler word for “sense of self”
[26/1/26, 13:56:19] ~ manav: where people retain cognition but lose whatever circuits ‘contain’ your sense of self in your body
[26/1/26, 13:57:03] ~ Odira: Yeah it’s called “ego dissolution” right?
[26/1/26, 13:57:06] Haziq KXHL: main character energy
[26/1/26, 13:57:16] ~ manav: there’s a great and short book about this called ‘my stroke of insight’ by dr jill bolte taylor
[26/1/26, 13:57:25] ~ Odira: “HIM”-like tendencies
[26/1/26, 13:57:45] ~ manav: you are literally a perfect double to haziq btw
[26/1/26, 13:58:21] ~ manav: absolutely insane. harvard neuroanatomist tracks the progression of her stroke as its happening
[26/1/26, 13:58:37] ~ manav: describes what regions of her brain are shutting down in situ. so cool
[26/1/26, 13:58:39] Haziq KXHL: twin, literally wrote an essay on him-ness the other day istg
[26/1/26, 13:58:52] ~ manav: also horrifying. obviously. she’s fine now
[26/1/26, 13:59:10] ~ Odira: I should stop understating my ability to keep up tho I’m sorry, I’m making all these jokes but I am absorbing what you’re saying and it’s fascinating. I like thought spirals like this where you have to try and bring the very matters of existence into logical bounds
[26/1/26, 13:59:31] ~ manav: gives ted talks about how she’s in a perpetual blissed out state upon realising that her selfhood is not stuck to your bodymind complex
[26/1/26, 13:59:56] ~ manav: Appreciated!! Dw I like the jokes keep them coming
[26/1/26, 14:00:40] ~ Odira: Bro wrote my biography for me wow
[26/1/26, 14:00:46] ~ Odira: Appreciated
[26/1/26, 14:01:05] ~ manav: Anyway I’ll reiterate that I still think it’s possible that mind states are not measurable but they are not unmeasurable _on principle_ if that makes sense. also circuit neuroscience has really good predictive power which makes me optimistic
[26/1/26, 14:02:15] ~ manav: also awareness/mind distinction gives us a good explanation as to why artificial neural networks can sometimes, in a very constrained sense, have biological plausibility. mind-like activity is not exotic, the quality of being a subject is
[26/1/26, 14:02:38] ~ Odira: Yeah I think it makes sense; we can gauge mind states in an abstract manner but not necessarily an empirically observable manner… or at least the lines between mind state and how that drives resultant processes is too blurry to parcellate
[26/1/26, 14:02:54] ~ manav: i genuinely think that’s a worst case
[26/1/26, 14:03:00] ~ manav: for sure that’s the minimum we can do
[26/1/26, 14:03:33] ~ manav: but imo it’s even possible that mind states are actual ‘stuff’ or totally reducible to some mathematical or geometric baseline reality like 3rd order rate based computation or some bs
[26/1/26, 14:04:22] ~ manav: a huge part of my hypothesis is that there is nothing exotic to minds and we tend to think there is because we fail to disambiguate awareness from mind
[26/1/26, 14:04:40] ~ manav: a good example of this is good old john o'keefe
[26/1/26, 14:05:05] ~ manav: who started off with a prior that euclidean space is an actual thing that exists in the brain because he was influenced by neo kantian philosophy
[26/1/26, 14:05:20] ~ manav: then he discovered place cells which literally encode a gps-like metric map
[26/1/26, 14:05:45] Haziq KXHL: No fr the feeling is mutual 😭 I’m a very classical biologist, I’m just absorbing this stuff from these guys via osmosis
[26/1/26, 14:05:55] ~ Odira: Ok now THIS STUFF I CAN KEEP UP WITH
[26/1/26, 14:06:03] ~ Odira: NEUROSCIENCE YES
[26/1/26, 14:06:38] ~ manav: yeah i agree that the prior stuff is not really neuroscience. i mostly think about the constraints within which neuroscience is actually possible
[26/1/26, 14:06:57] ~ manav: but i also believe that thinking really hard about those constraints drops out actual real neuroscience too
[26/1/26, 14:07:30] ~ Odira: Oh no I agree dw, I have somewhat philosophical questions often, I just don’t explore them
[26/1/26, 14:07:47] ~ manav: and now we have andrew macaskill at ucl who is at least as smart. super super underrated imo
[26/1/26, 14:07:53] ~ Odira: And those constraints inform future neuroscientists theories
[26/1/26, 14:08:14] ~ manav: have you come across his stuff on hidden state inference in the ventral hippocampus? some of my favourite experiments ever
[26/1/26, 14:08:17] ~ Odira: I believe he taught some lectures in one of my modules
[26/1/26, 14:08:54] ~ Odira: Haven’t come across his hidden state inference stuff but he did teach us of the vHPC in one of my systems neuro modules at Masters
[26/1/26, 14:10:06] ~ manav: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39571013/
[26/1/26, 14:10:08] ~ manav: Enjoy
[26/1/26, 14:10:50] ~ manav: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39939774/ also super beautiful
[26/1/26, 14:10:56] ~ manav: but less likely to be tru sadly
[26/1/26, 14:12:45] ~ Odira: Oh yes I have read this!!
[26/1/26, 14:13:03] ~ Odira: Well, I think I read some abstracts and got the idea of it ahahaha
[26/1/26, 14:13:31] ~ Odira: It was actually some of this reading which helped me change how I understand hippocampal system function
[26/1/26, 14:14:57] ~ manav: Yeah huge for me too
[26/1/26, 14:15:09] ~ manav: O’Keefe is definitely not thrilled
[26/1/26, 14:15:31] ~ manav: But it’s a very seductive idea. Alternate worlds exist as maps
[26/1/26, 14:16:03] ~ manav: And we ‘navigate’ decision trees in a neurologically literal way
[26/1/26, 14:16:41] ~ Odira: I mean I don’t see how it directly invalidates O’Keefe’s idea though, if anything it’s like how dopaminergic research was split into reward vs movement way back when but then later research made us realise that it does both and there is thus a more fundamental explanation for dopamine function that explains both reward and movement
[26/1/26, 14:16:51] ~ Odira: Yeah, one of my lecturers studies this
[26/1/26, 14:17:03] ~ manav: It doesn’t but it subsumes space
[26/1/26, 14:17:08] ~ manav: Into a broader notion of 'contexts'
[26/1/26, 14:17:08] ~ Odira: It’s almost like decision-making is just contextual spatial navigation
[26/1/26, 14:17:37] ~ manav: I also think that dorsal hippocampus retains some ‘space purity’
[26/1/26, 14:17:43] ~ Odira: Which is also fine no?
[26/1/26, 14:17:55] ~ manav: Yeah it’s totally fine but I know for a fact he isn’t happy about it lol
[26/1/26, 14:18:03] ~ manav: I spoke to him about it
[26/1/26, 14:18:26] ~ manav: You just get married to a paradigm
[26/1/26, 14:19:03] ~ Odira: I mean isn’t there a gradient going from dorsal to ventral that also matches physical to “abstract” in other neural systems? So it would make sense that it retains space purity ‎<This message was edited>
[26/1/26, 14:19:07] Haziq KXHL: fyi place cell representations live in a toroidal geometry which is distinct from a flat Euclidean space…
[26/1/26, 14:21:12] Haziq KXHL: also see: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009286742031388X
for a computational perspective
[26/1/26, 14:23:05] ~ Odira: Yeah pretty sure I came to this understanding autonomously so I’m glad that there’s a paper to actually put it into words for me to read and increase my knowledge
[26/1/26, 14:23:33] ~ Odira: Defo worth a read when I have the time
[26/1/26, 14:25:07] ~ manav: woah i thought this was just HD cells
[26/1/26, 14:25:35] Haziq KXHL: Oh sorry i tripped you’re right

[26/1/26, 14:25:51] ~ manav: ring attractor
[26/1/26, 14:25:57] ~ manav: very cool system
[26/1/26, 14:55:31] ~ Asia Miałkowska: ‎~ Asia Miałkowska joined using a group link.
[26/1/26, 14:36:05] Haziq KXHL: inner geometrist voice: ring attractors are 1d manifolds bc they live on a circle, grid cells are 2d manifolds bc they live on a torus
[26/1/26, 14:51:40] Haziq KXHL: hi, we’re building the operating system for first-person experience.

everything in neuroscience today is third-person. signals, circuits, correlates. saturated market.

we’re asking the next obvious question
*what about the user*
[26/1/26, 14:52:44] Haziq KXHL: *we build infrastructure for first-person alignment.*

what does that mean?
* a proprietary framework for distinguishing awareness from mental content
* awareness is the stable runtime
* thoughts, selves, emotions are hot swappable plugins
* most pathology is just bad plugin management

this unlocks an entirely new vertical we call
*subjective systems engineering*

our core moat is that *you literally cannot audit the product without using it*
[26/1/26, 14:55:38] Haziq KXHL: our competitors are:
* classical neuroscience (great at spikes. no idea who they’re spiking for)
* philosophy departments (2,400 years of runway. still pre product)
* organised religion (unbeatable retention. refuses to open source the backend)

our north star metric is *experiential coherence per joule*
dont ask how it’s computed, that’s proprietary
[26/1/26, 14:56:22] ~ manav: i’m sold
[26/1/26, 14:58:09] ~ manav: Tbh ‘open sourcing the backend of the religious esoteric’ is not even ALL that far off
[26/1/26, 15:01:32] ~ Odira: What is evening happening right now
[26/1/26, 15:01:47] ~ manav: memes only
[26/1/26, 15:01:53] ~ manav: nothing is being founded
[26/1/26, 15:01:56] Haziq KXHL: exit strategy:
* sell to big pharma when they realise SSRIs are just UI patches
* sell to big tech when they realise alignment starts before the training data
* sell to the military after rebranding “awareness” as “situational superiority”
* get banned in the EU then double valuation overnight
* spin out a DAO where governance is decided by meditation streaks
[26/1/26, 15:02:04] ~ Odira: I actually work for one of the competitors (Organised Religion)
[26/1/26, 15:02:51] Haziq KXHL: *we’re raising a $1B pre-product round*
the product is understanding why you hesitated
[26/1/26, 15:02:56] ~ Odira: I hear they’re actually not in this race and the actual big minds behind it aren’t opposed to Subjective Systems Engineering, heck they actually want some form of reasoning or understanding between both companies
[26/1/26, 15:03:10] ~ Odira: But hey that’s just a rumour
[26/1/26, 15:03:18] ~ Asia Miałkowska: idk what i just joined
[26/1/26, 15:03:44] Haziq KXHL: lol sorry just conciousness science brainrot, our apologies
[26/1/26, 15:04:05] ~ Odira: I’m not a consciousness science brain rot person
[26/1/26, 15:04:07] ~ Odira: I shock brain
[26/1/26, 15:04:10] ~ Odira: I hope brain fix
[26/1/26, 15:04:12] ~ Odira: It’s different
[26/1/26, 15:04:23] ~ Asia Miałkowska: 🤡
[26/1/26, 15:05:12] Haziq KXHL: @⁨~Asia Miałkowska⁩ 
Here’s a review of interesting new work on consciousness from my own field of developmental biology:
https://youtu.be/ur-zHu1TOOI?si=PhgOmWDCkvuryFoc
[26/1/26, 15:05:35] Haziq KXHL: and pls feel free to introduce yourself btw, we’re all mostly UCL neuro students
[26/1/26, 15:05:57] ~ Odira: Either are or former*
[26/1/26, 15:06:39] Haziq KXHL: wdym former, im still alive 😱
[26/1/26, 15:07:27] ~ Odira: Or what if I engineered your subjective experience for you to THINK you’re alive
[26/1/26, 15:14:38] Haziq KXHL: ahhh yes LSD
[26/1/26, 15:17:51] Haziq KXHL: brain: exists
us: ok but who is aware of it existing tho 😭
[26/1/26, 15:19:35] Haziq KXHL: @⁨~Tuhan Sapumanage⁩ you’re the private equity guy, do we take this to a16z or are they coming to us?
[26/1/26, 15:41:00] ~ manav: Formally disown any marketisation of my abstruse ideas
[26/1/26, 15:58:42] Haziq KXHL: “my” is doing a lot of work here, we’re already doing movie deals

[26/1/26, 16:29:17] ~ Laith: Does anyone here have access to a 3D printer/is willing to print something for me?
[26/1/26, 17:07:09] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: I mean I can do math to evaluate a business (that’s actually very easy! Just need confidence to trust yourself after!) but idk biology to understand the context, lol! ‎<This message was edited>
[26/1/26, 17:07:43] ~ Asia Miałkowska: tyyyy
[26/1/26, 17:07:53] ~ Asia Miałkowska: I’m a neurotech masters student at imperial
[26/1/26, 17:08:25] ~ Asia Miałkowska: working on modeling serotonin dynamics in human derived organoids
[26/1/26, 17:09:57] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: If you’re down we can whiteboard this for fun tho. So can first principle to evaluate n-th order effects and see ;) Purely for pleasure 😂 @⁨Haziq KXHL⁩ ‎<This message was edited>
[26/1/26, 18:48:55] Haziq KXHL: @⁨Niv Ucl Builder⁩ ought to know, bro is literally a hub in the watts-strogatz network
[26/1/26, 18:50:38] Haziq KXHL: 😭 brooo the signal-to-noise ratio in startups is so cooked rn that this sorta stuff actually flies. the pitch deck is the due diligence in 2026
[26/1/26, 18:54:44] Haziq KXHL: you’re tempting me ngl. i kinda wanna turn this into a pitch deck and cold send it to VCs just to sanity check the ecosystem
[26/1/26, 18:55:18] Haziq KXHL: not joking btw, very serious social experiment, u down?
[26/1/26, 18:57:12] Haziq KXHL: fyi i feel ethically great about this. if VCs are reading our deck they’re not investing in weapons so this is net positive impact. i’m basically an effective altruist now
[26/1/26, 18:58:11] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Sure, why not!
[26/1/26, 18:58:18] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: I can do Fri noons
[26/1/26, 19:00:39] Haziq KXHL: @⁨~manav⁩ ready for sokal affair 2.0?
[26/1/26, 19:01:21] ~ manav: lmao i’m not getting involved but go crazy
[26/1/26, 19:04:32] Haziq KXHL: omg bro first person to actually say yes to my mischief and malice 😭
but we’ll keep this clean like anonymise names, no receipts etc. last thing i want is anyone’s actual startup prospects getting cooked (except maybe my own lol)
[26/1/26, 19:07:14] ~ manav: it’s good bants and i’m all for freedom of ideas etc but don’t you think making a meme vc pitch about this paradigm is going to tarnish it before it even gets a solid shot in normal academia
[26/1/26, 19:15:02] Niv Ucl Builder: Hi, what would you like to print? @⁨~Laith⁩ ‎<This message was edited>
[26/1/26, 19:17:49] Haziq KXHL: understood, pivoting to quantum shrimp
[26/1/26, 19:18:27] Haziq KXHL: ok but this feels like a group activity. who else wants in?
[26/1/26, 19:21:01] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Do you guys know what ‘Algorave’ is
[26/1/26, 19:21:11] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: It’s like coding while EDM nightclub? That’s so cool 😂😂
[26/1/26, 19:23:59] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: If KXHL was that I’d come even every day 😭
[26/1/26, 19:24:18] Haziq KXHL: lol yes just a lil fast fourier transform + sync w/ LED matrix, wait lemme show u mine
[26/1/26, 19:25:05] Haziq KXHL: had to jailbreak my laptop back cover LEDs for this trash:
[26/1/26, 19:25:33] Haziq KXHL: (only to get a pathetic lag in the end 🫠 but we ball)

[26/1/26, 19:27:46] Haziq KXHL: KXHL isn’t a place it’s a mode of being. welcome
[26/1/26, 19:29:57] Haziq KXHL: @⁨~Elma ⁩ @⁨~samia 💗🌸⁩ any chance of a quick consulting lens on our “venture” before we accidentally raise a seed round?
[26/1/26, 19:35:44] Haziq KXHL: *Sokal affair tl;dr* UCL physicist wrote a paper full of fake physics and postmodern buzzwords about quantum gravity being socially constructed, journal published it, he immediately went “btw this was a bit lol”, everyone realised postmodern philosophy was a hoax (altho i rate it highly personally, very elegant hoax)
[26/1/26, 20:05:08] ~ manav: Hate to bat for the postmodernists but I think it’s worth noting that it was a pretty crap journal
[26/1/26, 20:05:55] ~ manav: Pretty sure greater bunk and outright lies make up the majority of cureus’ medical publications
[26/1/26, 20:12:04] ~ Laith: A rib cage lol ‎<This message was edited>

[26/1/26, 21:19:57] Niv Ucl Builder: 😭😭😭
[26/1/26, 21:20:06] Niv Ucl Builder: i think ill need a bit more details than that sadly
[26/1/26, 21:20:16] Niv Ucl Builder: we should talk during next KXHL!
[26/1/26, 23:12:36] Haziq KXHL: @⁨~Tuhan Sapumanage⁩ ??
[26/1/26, 23:18:34] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Well,
- Based on my current understanding of the quantum space the problem and theoretical words adds up but whether it’s feasible, I don’t know enough to answer that.
- ⁠The deck has buzzwords but hasn’t answered any financial questions nor a team that shows a track record (they might be amazing. Deck doesn’t show so).

If I was a VC might take a call for intellectual curiosity but deck alone I didn’t think it’s a go?
[26/1/26, 23:18:39] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: ^
[26/1/26, 23:19:41] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Like it says they’re trynna solve instability with biology-inspired something but it doesn’t say status or how or anything?
[26/1/26, 23:20:13] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Again I might be wrong so feels theoretical and more WeWork vibes 😂
[26/1/26, 23:20:25] Haziq KXHL: it’s all intellectual property 🤐 hush hush
[26/1/26, 23:20:56] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Now it sounds like Theranos 😭
‎[26/1/26, 23:21:28] Haziq KXHL: ‎GIF omitted
[26/1/26, 23:21:34] Haziq KXHL: team is GOATed tho, literally professor doofenshmirtz is in there 😭
[26/1/26, 23:21:35] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: But what state is it at?
[26/1/26, 23:21:46] Haziq KXHL: pre seed, patent pending
[26/1/26, 23:21:54] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: No I meant the tech
[26/1/26, 23:22:00] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Is it POC proven?
[26/1/26, 23:22:02] Haziq KXHL: that’s good!! Theranos got funded
[26/1/26, 23:22:29] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Or more like lab trials k need to do a prototype for actual commercial
[26/1/26, 23:22:46] Haziq KXHL: yes yes ofc it’s proven bleeding edge quantum shrimp™️ technology
[26/1/26, 23:23:06] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Shrimp? 😂
[26/1/26, 23:23:28] Haziq KXHL: 😭😭😭 it’s all made up bro, that’s why it’s a social experiment, signal to noise ratio is so bad it’s not even discernible anymore
[26/1/26, 23:24:01] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: If it’s proven I’d focus more on the fact that it’s proven, what money will be used for (is it more R&D or how close to generate revenue) and board. Rest of it is just buzzwords lol…
[26/1/26, 23:24:48] Haziq KXHL: bro im telling u, it’s literally quantum shrimp, 100% fake 😭😭
[26/1/26, 23:25:06] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: I am so confused right now 😂
[26/1/26, 23:25:17] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: I didn’t read the convo around quantum shrimp so I have no context lol
[26/1/26, 23:25:23] Haziq KXHL: wait there’s this scene from this Hindi movie… ‎<This message was edited>
[26/1/26, 23:26:41] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: In other news coming back from UCL-Bloomberg event on ‘6-5, blue eyes, finance, trust fund’
[26/1/26, 23:26:49] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: AT L50, OCS 😂
[26/1/26, 23:27:20] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: (For the record no longer in finance. Tech has moat 😋…)
[26/1/26, 23:27:27] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Just intellectual curiosity
[26/1/26, 23:27:40] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Tho I beat the S&P last yr

Most iconic Bollywood production imo, there’s captions for those who don’t speak Hindi
[26/1/26, 23:27:49] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: For fun 😂
[26/1/26, 23:28:05] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: …I don’t speak Hindi either lol
[26/1/26, 23:28:14] Haziq KXHL: *but yeah this is basically what quantum shrimp is
[26/1/26, 23:28:16] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: But I’ve seen memes of this
[26/1/26, 23:28:25] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Wait is it the three idots one?
[26/1/26, 23:28:32] Haziq KXHL: yes!!!
[26/1/26, 23:28:42] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Omg I saw this in 2012 or something
[26/1/26, 23:28:47] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Or 2010
[26/1/26, 23:29:26] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Theyve a bike scene action stunt part too? Or was it a different one?
[26/1/26, 23:29:49] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: (I know that’s def not the main plot)
[26/1/26, 23:30:01] Haziq KXHL: this is not an action movie at all, it’s a critique of the education industrial complex
[26/1/26, 23:30:55] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Makes sense. They were binge watching movies back to back
[26/1/26, 23:31:17] Haziq KXHL: *the education industrial complex which represses critical thinking to the point that we don’t realise quantum shrimp is made up 😭😭
[26/1/26, 23:31:27] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Hahaha
[26/1/26, 23:35:20] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: This is so fire

[27/1/26, 13:30:15] Hera KXHL: feels like something you folks would want to discuss
[27/1/26, 13:34:36] ~ Adam: machines of loving grace?
[27/1/26, 13:34:39] Hera KXHL: the country of geniuses thing is an interesting idea, i wonder how realistic that framing is though
[27/1/26, 13:34:45] Hera KXHL: he wrote a follow up
[27/1/26, 13:34:53] Hera KXHL: called the adolescence of technology

[27/1/26, 15:18:56] ~ Ada Ge: for high schoolers not sure if you guys know any
[27/1/26, 15:19:26] ~ Ada Ge: this is the um. making billionaires live longer stuff. which i know haziq lovingly appreciates. it's like his calling and passion
[27/1/26, 15:37:39] Haziq KXHL: meh 🫤 this is not longevity per se so im not too bothered
[27/1/26, 15:51:22] ~ Odira: I feel like I had a discussion something like this, but tuned more to prove a point in a debate 😂
[27/1/26, 15:51:45] ~ Odira: A debate which I don’t get into here because it was… charged, to say the least.
[27/1/26, 15:52:15] Haziq KXHL: @⁨~Odira⁩ welcome back!!
[27/1/26, 15:52:35] ~ Odira: I might disappear again bro I got an ethics approval to write
[27/1/26, 15:52:46] ~ Odira: Can’t just shock people for free
[27/1/26, 15:52:56] Haziq KXHL: LOL bro u still haven’t witnessed KXHL after hours, that’s when the real stuff goes down
[27/1/26, 15:53:37] Haziq KXHL: Btw they are having a session tomorrow evening if u wanna attend??
[27/1/26, 15:53:43] ~ Odira: If I have time I will try
[27/1/26, 15:53:50] ~ Odira: Wdym they?? You’re not going????
[27/1/26, 15:54:09] Haziq KXHL: bit of a fever unfortunately 🤒

[27/1/26, 15:55:11] Haziq KXHL: Our KXHL startup btw, pls forward to any investors
[27/1/26, 16:00:07] Haziq KXHL: wait who said ageing research is bad??
interventions, research etc to help avg people live normal healthy lives is good actually
problem is silicon valley cartoon villains (thiel, RFK jr, o’neill) capturing policy
cutting public ageing care & weakening regulation so rich ppl get experimental toys and everyone else gets worse healthcare
[27/1/26, 16:05:09] Haziq KXHL: ahhh yes, accessible youth programming for the stanford dorm demographic

[27/1/26, 16:06:58] ~ Odira: I’m just a tall chocolate man who likes brains
[27/1/26, 16:07:03] Haziq KXHL: would u donate to shrimp anasthesia tho?
[27/1/26, 16:07:15] ~ Odira: …elaborate.
[27/1/26, 16:07:27] Haziq KXHL: ok ok ur good, my man

[27/1/26, 16:07:48] ~ Odira: Confusion.
[27/1/26, 16:07:59] Haziq KXHL: its called effective altruism apparently idk

[27/1/26, 16:09:19] ~ Odira: Haziq bro wtf do you people talk about in here 😭
[27/1/26, 16:09:38] ~ Odira: I just came to learn quantum-ese and now I’m being probed as to whether I donate to shrimp anaesthesia
[27/1/26, 16:09:44] ~ Odira: REFEREE
[27/1/26, 16:09:55] ~ Odira: IM IN THE WRONG FLIPPIN SPORT
[27/1/26, 16:10:10] Haziq KXHL: bro honestly idk im a very insider outsider over here, im a democratic socialist biologist stuck in a techno-libertarian hack club 😭😭
[27/1/26, 16:11:29] Haziq KXHL: yet to hear your thoughts on our startup btw 🤔
pitch deck was written in pure quantum-ese
[27/1/26, 16:12:22] Haziq KXHL: honestly anything above a certain threshold of crazy is game in KXHL 😭

[27/1/26, 16:14:45] Haziq KXHL: they all think its legit!!
[27/1/26, 16:15:17] Haziq KXHL: its literally quantum crab bro 😭
[27/1/26, 16:15:18] ~ Odira: Please tell me I’m not the only one who saw “Chad Harrington” as a name and knew this was a joke…
[27/1/26, 16:15:40] ~ Odira: Bro show me Doofenshmirtz CV tho
[27/1/26, 16:16:01] Haziq KXHL: bro signal to noise ratio is so low in the startup world rn that this sorta stuff actually flies 😭😭

[27/1/26, 16:22:08] Haziq KXHL: extending dog lifespans before we fix human healthcare is so on brand actually
+ FDA advisor teaching kids that oversight is just friction 🔥🔥
[27/1/26, 16:34:26] ~ Ada Ge: i mean, there's logic and selection pressures behind these actions! it would make sense if you were in their situation
[27/1/26, 16:34:58] ~ Ada Ge: dogs have shorter lifespans so they're easier to test on, plus people are willing to spend to keep their pets healthy, and the regulations are slightly lower
[27/1/26, 16:35:03] ~ Ada Ge: That makes sense right?
[27/1/26, 16:35:26] ~ Ada Ge: their end goal is human lifespan obviously
[27/1/26, 16:35:51] ~ Ada Ge: dog lifespan is the proxy task which also hopefully generates revenue
[27/1/26, 16:36:37] ~ Ada Ge: which is good, because you're independent of grants and science cuts, and reviewer 2
[27/1/26, 16:37:27] ~ Ada Ge: im glad this exists because it's a "try lots of different things to see what works" play to have lots of different kinds of organizations which research is done under
[27/1/26, 16:37:34] ~ Ada Ge: pluralism is great for information gathering
[27/1/26, 16:38:20] ~ Ada Ge: something something uncorrelated bets
[27/1/26, 16:39:54] Haziq KXHL: bad proxy...
[27/1/26, 16:40:06] ~ Ada Ge: FINE
[27/1/26, 16:40:13] ~ Ada Ge: I KNOW HOW BAD ANIMAL MODELS ARE
[27/1/26, 16:40:36] Haziq KXHL: we are literally moving away from animal models mice etc toward organoids spheroids and human derived platforms bc animal ageing biology translates like 🤬
it has been a pretty trash way of doing science overall
[27/1/26, 16:41:00] Haziq KXHL: NOOO u havent felt the pain first hand, u havent cried over it, u havent bled
[27/1/26, 16:41:08] Haziq KXHL: do you know how many “conserved targets” ive had to deal with that turned out to be pseudogenes in humans 😭
[27/1/26, 16:41:18] ~ Ada Ge: idk 5 ???
[27/1/26, 16:41:30] Haziq KXHL: so if their intent is dogs as a proxy for humans that is at least understandable economically but it is still an idiotic way of doing science nonetheless
[27/1/26, 16:43:59] Haziq KXHL: which grants? the grants u just cut so ppl are more desperate and reliant on the private ecosystem?
[27/1/26, 16:45:06] ~ Ada Ge: i feel like the meme where there is a girl yelling knives into a guy's chest
[27/1/26, 16:45:18] Haziq KXHL: btw reviewer 2 is why half the garbage in private biotech never sees daylight
sorry someone asked for controls
[27/1/26, 17:08:49] Haziq KXHL: ive actually made a pledge that every time i dunk on shrimp welfare i also have to promote shrimp welfare so here we are
https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/
[27/1/26, 17:10:24] Haziq KXHL: @⁨~Odira⁩ lets see if i can convince u
every year TRILLIONS of shrimp are boiled alive (numbers so big u stop feeling them) and some ppl think shrimp might feel pain or at least have a bad time idk the literature is contested

so if u reduce shrimp suffering by even 0.0001 percent thats still morally enormous if u squint hard enough
[27/1/26, 17:25:39] ~ Odira: …I’m still going to make creamy shrimp tagliatelle.
[27/1/26, 18:24:16] Haziq KXHL: lowkey living life w/o creamy shrimp tagliatelle is the real suffering we should be tryna reduce
[27/1/26, 18:24:26] Haziq KXHL: also btw im literally the masterchef here so lets not act brand new
[27/1/26, 18:27:41] ~ Odira: The guy who sits behind me in my office was literally on MasterChef Australia as a kid bro it’s like having Sir Alex Ferguson as coach
[27/1/26, 18:34:47] Haziq KXHL: bruh im the sole heir to generations of culinary knowledge
i whipped a rosemary & onion focaccia, a maple pecan babka and a pistachio & rose macaron all in the same day because i was bored
there are levels to this game mind u
[27/1/26, 18:40:18] ~ Odira: I can tell someone who ain’t who he thinks he is, by his boisterous description of what he cooked
[27/1/26, 18:40:40] ~ Odira: Ask my MasterChef guy what he cooked he’ll say “just a lil sumn” and it’s Michelin star

[27/1/26, 23:56:59] Haziq KXHL: never that deep 🙄
[27/1/26, 23:57:07] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: 🤣🤣
[27/1/26, 23:57:32] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Ive work tomo byeee
[28/1/26, 00:01:50] ~ Ada Ge: i actually was reading a thing about communities / social networks
[28/1/26, 00:02:04] Haziq KXHL: lets hear it...
[28/1/26, 00:02:37] ~ Ada Ge: https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service
[28/1/26, 00:02:49] ~ Ada Ge: it brings capitalism as a lens to look at communities
[28/1/26, 00:03:04] ~ Ada Ge: i think this is kinda cool
[28/1/26, 00:03:08] Haziq KXHL: tl;dr?
[28/1/26, 00:03:30] ~ Ada Ge: Social capital is, in many ways, a leading indicator of financial capital, and so its nature bears greater scrutiny. Not only is it good investment or business practice, but analyzing social capital dynamics can help to explain all sorts of online behavior that would otherwise seem irrational.

In the past few years, much progress has been made analyzing Software as a Service (SaaS) businesses. Not as much has been made on social networks. Analysis of social networks still strikes me as being like economic growth theory long before Paul Romer’s paper on endogenous technological change. However, we can start to demystify social networks if we also think of them as SaaS businesses, but instead of software, they provide status.



Can I use the social network to accumulate social capital? What forms? How is it measured? And how do I earn that status?



This is the classic cold start problem of social. The answer to the traditional chicken-and-egg question is actually answerable: what comes first is a single chicken, and then another chicken, and then another chicken, and so on. The harder version of the question is why the first chicken came and stayed when no other chickens were around, and why the others followed.
[28/1/26, 00:03:38] ~ Ada Ge: quotes i picked out
[28/1/26, 00:04:15] ~ Ada Ge: sorry the formatting gets lost - three seperate quotes
[28/1/26, 00:04:59] Haziq KXHL: what are they trying to say Ada?!
[28/1/26, 00:05:04] Haziq KXHL: im a simple man, pls explain
[28/1/26, 00:08:59] ~ Ada Ge: social networks generate status and that's something that keeps people in and draws people in
[28/1/26, 00:09:55] ~ Ada Ge: to generate status you have to generate a gradient of status from high to low - this is coupled with "proofs of work", different on different platforms
[28/1/26, 00:10:01] Haziq KXHL: ok that sounds reasonable...
[28/1/26, 00:10:18] Haziq KXHL: well this is a social network, apply that theory, incriminate some ppl, shoot
[28/1/26, 00:11:06] Haziq KXHL: also make some predictions, thats the true test of a theory
[28/1/26, 00:12:17] Haziq KXHL: but like keep the predictions to urself tho or else ppl will act brand new as if theyre above all that 🙄
[28/1/26, 00:12:49] Haziq KXHL: and then u can go "Hah! I knew this fool was gonna do this" later
[28/1/26, 00:16:33] ~ Elma : Yes give us an example queen
[28/1/26, 00:16:39] ~ Elma : Tbis is so interesting
[28/1/26, 00:17:56] Haziq KXHL: no wait im actually scared 😭 cos i will probably be receiving 9 out of the 10 incriminations
[28/1/26, 00:18:33] ~ Elma : Wdym
[28/1/26, 00:18:41] Haziq KXHL: proof of work in KXHL is probably something like how unhinged and self destructive u can be in pursuit of STEM
[28/1/26, 00:19:03] Haziq KXHL: which is my personality at this point 🤦‍♂️
[28/1/26, 00:19:14] ~ Ada Ge: i guess
[28/1/26, 00:19:46] Haziq KXHL: @⁨~Ada Ge⁩ is basically telling us to get a life guys 😭
[28/1/26, 00:19:55] ~ Ada Ge: no no no
[28/1/26, 00:19:58] ~ Ada Ge: i like you guys like this
[28/1/26, 00:20:02] ~ Ada Ge: that's why im here
[28/1/26, 00:20:22] Haziq KXHL: in that case…
[28/1/26, 00:21:01] Haziq KXHL: u know how ppl go insane when they get engaged or have a baby and suddenly everyone has to hear about it??
[28/1/26, 00:21:11] Haziq KXHL: like their neighbour, his grandma and her dog
‎[28/1/26, 00:21:37] Haziq KXHL: yeah that’s me rn except my baby is this plot ‎image omitted
[28/1/26, 00:21:59] Haziq KXHL: this is why im awake at this cursed hour
[28/1/26, 00:22:30] Haziq KXHL: culmination of many all nighters worth of work 😭😭
[28/1/26, 00:23:22] Haziq KXHL: and i WILL be showing it to anyone who makes eye contact
[28/1/26, 00:25:00] Haziq KXHL: *graph that connects one calcium channel to whether a pregnancy works
[28/1/26, 00:36:27] Haziq KXHL: **necessary, not sufficient... for normal placental development
[28/1/26, 00:36:54] Haziq KXHL: had to clarify cos of reviewer 2 trauma
[28/1/26, 01:55:06] ~ Ada Ge: I would love to hear you explain this methodology
[28/1/26, 11:15:39] Haziq KXHL: tbh this squint-and-you’ll-miss-it correlation plot doesn’t have that much evidential value 😭 it’s basically just the top hit from the algorithm which then got validated downstream by RNA interference 🥳
[28/1/26, 11:20:55] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: It’s a nice feeling tho 😂
[28/1/26, 11:20:59] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: When you have it once in a while
[28/1/26, 11:21:04] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: 😭😭
[28/1/26, 11:26:00] Haziq KXHL: they already knew that knocking out this calcium channel in placenta progenitors messes up placental development. the problem is that progenitors branch into many different placental cell types so my job was basically to data-mine which specific "cell fate transition" this channel is actually essential for
[28/1/26, 11:28:04] Haziq KXHL: this is done using the most cracked modality of data ever called single-cell RNA sequencing where you basically get the full gene expression profile of every individual cell in the tissue. it’s so information-rich that ngl it feels like you could infer the cell’s star sign from it 😭
[28/1/26, 11:32:06] Haziq KXHL: the catch is that this data doesn’t actually have a time axis so I gotta write a cell fate mapping algorithm to infer a pseudotime and track what’s happening over development
‎[28/1/26, 11:33:58] Haziq KXHL: looks something like this... idk if this fig has much explanatory value but i think its cool 🙂‍↕️ ‎image omitted
[28/1/26, 11:40:02] Haziq KXHL: punchline... the ion channel is essential for maturation of this cell type called syncytiotrophoblast which istg is one of the coolest cell types ever. a virus infected us forever ago and left behind a protein and evolution repurposed it so immune cells can’t get into the placenta bc the placenta is like 50% dad genes and mum’s immune system would absolutely lose it
[28/1/26, 14:47:17] Haziq KXHL: also zooming out to policy and funding for a sec bc this always gets me. this work is at the institute for women’s health (IfWH) and the goal is literally just keep mum and baby healthy during pregnancy bc placental defects mess up both…
[28/1/26, 14:47:54] Haziq KXHL: i think it’s kinda off that the money for this has to come from the vanishingly small pool of women’s health investment which is already hardly enough (like istg we have literally 0 endometriosis labs at the ifwh cos there is no money… cervical cancer says hi) instead of a broader pool
[28/1/26, 14:48:36] Haziq KXHL: it feels like there’s an implicit assumption that baby’s health is a woman’s problem so it gets put in that bracket meanwhile they will very casually spend the big general pool on things like male pattern baldness with zero hesitation
[28/1/26, 14:49:12] Haziq KXHL: if there was actual symmetry money for prostate cancer would be spent from a tiny “men’s health” funding pool which would also be responsible for funding baby health and everyone would immediately see how insane that is 😵‍💫
[28/1/26, 14:57:48] Haziq KXHL: *not even being a woke feminist lib rn just curious why “applied mathematician (150k) x developmental biologist (120k) x bioinformatician (140k) x software engineer (160k)” somehow multiplies out to an unpaid role at the IfWH 🫥 ‎<This message was edited>

@⁨Haziq KXHL⁩ the cancer VC funding you need
[31/1/26, 10:19:39] Haziq KXHL: “from death sentence to chronic disease” = cancer-as-a-service (CaaS)
[31/1/26, 10:24:42] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Wtf 😂
[31/1/26, 10:25:21] Haziq KXHL: One sec one sec, there’s deep lore 😄
[31/1/26, 10:26:41] Haziq KXHL: tbh this kinda funding will never be aligned with my interests which are curative therapeutics
[31/1/26, 10:27:06] Haziq KXHL: for anyone confused: non-curative = symptom management / chronic dosing / “see you every month forever”
[31/1/26, 10:27:55] Haziq KXHL: big pharma / VC aversion to cures isn’t a conspiracy or anything it’s literally econ 101, every public sector PI i’ve ever worked with drilled this into me
[31/1/26, 10:29:42] Haziq KXHL: it’s not that cures are some mystical higher bar, they’re just financially cursed
close friend spinning out a cancer cell therapy startup and a key pitch point was “we can keep selling it because it degrades” yikes 😬
[31/1/26, 10:34:56] Haziq KXHL: @⁨~Elma ⁩ this is literally why i fell out with EF. they told me verbatim “curative therapies are not investable” so now i’m doing it on public sector fumes and a 20 year horizon 🥲
[31/1/26, 17:44:28] Haziq KXHL: @⁨~manav⁩ a contention (very possibly one you’ve already answered adequately and i’m just being dumb again)… i think it’s sorta disingenuous to start with transcendental unity of apperception as an epistemological necessity / bookkeeping axiom and then let that scope-creep into ontology especially when we’re talking about therapeutic interventions involving awareness

i find the epistemology bit quite palatable, but the jump is a bit… 😬 the move from “necessary for experience” to “thing that exists / can be intervened on” feels under-argued to me
[31/1/26, 17:45:44] ~ manav: good evening
[31/1/26, 17:48:36] ~ manav: i think this is pretty difficult. you’re right that making the jump from ‘condition for the possibility of experience’ to ontological ground is substantial
[31/1/26, 17:49:13] Haziq KXHL: oops sorry 😭 where are my manners hi hope you’re well, breathing and alive (exactly in that order)
‎[31/1/26, 17:51:43] ~ Odira: ‎GIF omitted
[31/1/26, 17:54:11] ~ manav: so when Kant talks about TUA it’s just the thing underneath “i think”, a formal condition. but if TUA is just a limit-concept then what grounds the phenomenal appearances themselves? Kant would talk about things-in-themselves or whatever. But is this really more rigorous? Positing an unknowable X that somehow gives rise to phenomenality. It’s an outrageous but (to me) more parsimonious thing to say that the appearances themselves must *be* the ground, just differently apprehended. I.e. conditions superimposed upon the TUA generate phenomenality
[31/1/26, 17:55:52] ~ manav: Another way to look at this is reflexivity. The thing that makes knowing possible can’t merely be formal, because formality already presupposes it
[31/1/26, 18:25:11] Haziq KXHL: oh wow that actually sounds pretty defensible… a de-Cartesian TUA. reflexive awareness as self-evidencing, not needing epistemic justification with epistemic norms arising from it. Awesome!!
[31/1/26, 18:26:10] ~ manav: I have no idea how you managed to understand what I meant so well
[31/1/26, 18:26:50] ~ manav: I explained it terribly but yeah that’s the idea
[31/1/26, 18:29:27] ~ Odira: Yeah me neither.
[31/1/26, 18:40:51] Haziq KXHL: idk man u just keep casually increasing the average IQ of hack club and i’m doing my best to keep up 😭
[31/1/26, 18:41:52] ~ manav: way too kind
[31/1/26, 18:42:32] ~ manav: upgraded laptop today guys 🔥
[31/1/26, 18:43:45] Haziq KXHL: pls do show off we need to see it
[31/1/26, 18:45:14] Haziq KXHL: tbh I’m very partial to custom PC builds but ngl mobility is such an issue, I’d need a baby stroller or something
[31/1/26, 18:46:13] Yi Hein: ur luggage works fine though
[31/1/26, 18:48:45] Haziq KXHL: i went through Stanford plato philosophy encyclopedia, daily mail, urban dictionary and my grandma’s cookbook. last three gave the most insight
[31/1/26, 18:49:03] ~ manav: Boring old mba
[31/1/26, 18:51:40] Haziq KXHL: no comment, i’m spiritually opposed to off the shelf compute 🫥 but i do rate insane chinese gaming laptops highly
[31/1/26, 18:52:48] ~ manav: In another life I too built my PC
[31/1/26, 18:53:05] ~ manav: These are just too good tho
[31/1/26, 18:57:52] Haziq KXHL: yeah they’re great, it’s just painful bc for the same money you could get way more cpu/gpu, double the ram, faster nvme and actual thermals in a custom build 😖
[31/1/26, 18:59:09] Haziq KXHL: paying a premium for less compute and a half eaten apple 😭 (@⁨~manav⁩’s boomer influence is spreading)
[31/1/26, 19:03:51] ~ manav: Is this acc true? Pretty sure M4 is insanely good and efficient and with current RAM set prices Apple is kind of a deal
[31/1/26, 19:56:40] Haziq KXHL: M4 is cracked on efficiency for sure. it’s only a deal if the base config fits you, bc apple upgrades are where the pain begins
‎[31/1/26, 20:02:14] Haziq KXHL: btw have u guys seen the IfWH 😖 derelict building, defo some kinda mortar factory in a past life, rust bucket computers and still no access to UCL RDC bc clearly no dry lab person has ever set foot here. so anyway I’m now providing my own custom builds as vital infrastructure 😭 ‎image omitted

[1/2/26, 12:12:08] Haziq KXHL: ok so u know how i’m always saying the UKRI CDT is the most cushy PhD 😭

[1/2/26, 16:30:05] Haziq KXHL: but maybe we should all listen to Marie Kondo bc my dawg Jordie insists the lobsters are out to get u otherwise
[1/2/26, 16:57:40] Haziq KXHL: crazy indeed but the alternatives are …
it’s all fun and games to cheer public research from the sidelines but IRL the zeitgeist is bleak
you can literally bet your life on research directions and the money still never shows up
but ppl still work insanely hard here not bc of carrot-on-a-stick incentives like industry but bc the lab is in a hospital and the patients are right there.
survivor guilt is one helluva drug
[1/2/26, 17:02:43] Haziq KXHL: @⁨~samia 💗🌸⁩ btw the kitten in ur dp is CUTE, i had one too but it ran away and left me with a permanently fearful-avoidant attachment style

[1/2/26, 18:48:37] ~ samia 💗🌸: 😭
[1/2/26, 19:04:26] Haziq KXHL: tbf i must confess i’m no expert in Arabic, just semi literate
bc i once ran a reading club called
“history and evolution of Islamic theology w a focus on post-golden age and contemporary implications”
had to shut it down after my audience defected to rival clubs like
“Arabic love poetry” and “Islamic perspective on the love languages” 🫠
[1/2/26, 19:05:47] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: A cat is why capitalism lost you? That’s a crazy butterfly effect 😂

[1/2/26, 19:06:38] ~ Alex Pylypenko: would it not just be a different spelling of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakim_(name)
[1/2/26, 19:07:17] ~ Alex Pylypenko: world class consultant behaviour, or alternatively, world class GCSE <insert modern language> student.
[1/2/26, 19:41:50] Haziq KXHL: yes precisely, it’s what linguists call onomastic borrowing. Arabic حكيم (Hakim) became Yoruba Akím then Akeem
[1/2/26, 19:45:33] Haziq KXHL: agreed, GCSE language proficiency legally absolves all cultural appropriation charges
[1/2/26, 19:45:59] Haziq KXHL: plus i get a special exemption on account of being ethnoreligiously heterogeneous
[1/2/26, 20:38:21] ~ samia 💗🌸: Islamic perspectives on the love languages is wild lol
[1/2/26, 20:59:42] Haziq KXHL: u know bro made it when he starts talking in plurals 😭 we need to see katie now, drop a photo

[1/2/26, 21:13:16] Haziq KXHL: rigorous theology no match for yearning 😔 tbf they did teach u sick lines like

وما كنتُ ممّن يدخلُ العشقُ قلبَهُ
ولكنْ مَن يُبصِرْ جفونَكِ يعشَقِ

which is very fancy lyrical prose for
“i was NOT built for love actually

[1/2/26, 21:18:49] ~ samia 💗🌸: this is bullying
[1/2/26, 21:24:15] Haziq KXHL: just fyi i read what he said as mocking me. like poking fun at my comment that using names from other cultures counts as cultural appropriation because taken far enough that would mean even doing a GCSE language is cultural appropriation.
but honestly i don’t know what he actually intended, text is ambiguous and a lot gets lost over chat
[1/2/26, 21:24:19] Haziq KXHL: @⁨~Alex Pylypenko⁩
[1/2/26, 21:24:44] ~ Alex Pylypenko: Wtf are you reading
[1/2/26, 21:25:23] ~ Alex Pylypenko: What I meant was "GCSE language speaking exams are contrived as hell and it's a common strategy to 'invent imaginary siblings / pets' in order to get more marks"
[1/2/26, 21:25:32] ~ Alex Pylypenko: 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

[1/2/26, 21:32:46] ~ samia 💗🌸: consultant hate is welcome but just dont aim it at me im an innocent non consultant darling
[1/2/26, 21:33:09] Haziq KXHL: oh i didn’t read any malice into it at all, i thought it was funny tbh (assuming my interpretation was correct)
[1/2/26, 21:37:16] Haziq KXHL: squinting past the fact u spontaneously _*pivoted*_ to non-consultant while claiming to not be a consultant

[1/2/26, 21:47:18] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: My fav quote 😂

[1/2/26, 21:54:04] Haziq KXHL: also btw i have dibs on the attributes innocent and darling.
best i can do for you is level headed and occasionally a little scary
[1/2/26, 21:58:29] ~ samia 💗🌸: im the most non scary person u will meet
[1/2/26, 21:58:53] ~ samia 💗🌸: @⁨~Alex Pylypenko⁩ do you think im level headed and occassionally a little scary
[1/2/26, 21:59:01] ~ Alex Pylypenko: yes
[1/2/26, 21:59:43] ~ samia 💗🌸: that doesnt sound authentic

[1/2/26, 22:14:15] ~ samia 💗🌸: evening affirmation - i am not frightening 💆‍♀️
[1/2/26, 22:17:19] Haziq KXHL: not u!! it’s ur aura 😭 just a little uncanny seeing we’re the same age and you’re so put together while we’re still 20 year old children
[1/2/26, 22:18:50] Haziq KXHL: *think baby jesus taking type of scary

[2/2/26, 12:03:36] Haziq KXHL: cos i was minding my own business and then you brought up this ipseity business and made me trip so id say youre accountable and in return u r responsible for my post situationship glow up
[2/2/26, 12:05:57] Haziq KXHL: @⁨~Ada Ge⁩ i don’t like to repeat myself…
“not so gentle reminder that this gc has a _very_ low tolerance for innuendos and implicit references to explicit stuff
it’s not giving charisma, it’s giving secondhand embarrassment 
not asking anyone to follow victorian social norms, just keep it at Disney level pls
thanks”
[2/2/26, 12:15:24] Haziq KXHL: ok fyi _*she*_ was entirely a plot device as im yet to meet someone who says youre crazy affectionately but happy to drop the poem or the notes on consciousness below on request cos im nothing if not charitable ‎<This message was edited>
[2/2/26, 12:21:49] ~ Ada Ge: OK I WONT DO IT AGAIN SORRY!
[2/2/26, 12:22:13] ~ Ada Ge: can we please see the poem? 👀

[2/2/26, 12:36:30] ~ Ada Ge: I thought you wrote it

[2/2/26, 23:41:48] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Rule of thumb people - just go for things in life 😭 Worst case, you’ll learn how this application process works!
[2/2/26, 23:45:38] ~ Suhas: There was another role that used to take undergrads / masters but has been terminated as of last summer. Just pointing out that this isn't that role unfortunately
[2/2/26, 23:47:27] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: That caveat helps :) But yeah, just go for it champ cuz lol :)

[3/2/26, 00:25:23] ~ Ada Ge: Guys arc is offering
[3/2/26, 00:25:34] ~ Ada Ge: A thing
[3/2/26, 00:25:36] ~ Ada Ge: This is big
[3/2/26, 00:38:02] Haziq KXHL: yeah yeah first time arc is opening up undergrad internships
[3/2/26, 00:38:17] Haziq KXHL: But note it’s only for NA students, not global
[3/2/26, 00:42:48] Haziq KXHL: also foundation models… meh 😑 useful but no flair
[3/2/26, 00:44:41] Haziq KXHL: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09876-1
this stuff is fun, this is what our lab does at arc

[3/2/26, 00:50:11] Haziq KXHL: 💔🥀
[3/2/26, 00:52:25] Haziq KXHL: i can confirm IfWH is feeling the burn, we were hoping some grants will come through for some really promising targets on fetal growth restriction and pre eclampsia. unclear what the future holds
[3/2/26, 11:18:16] Haziq KXHL: i’m going to be blunt. i’ve never seen a research field this dire. i used to think malaria and vector borne diseases were the worst off but they are at least sustained by gates and similar funders. women’s health does not have that safety net at all and we are feeling it hard. the medical research council was hit especially hard in the cuts
[3/2/26, 11:27:46] Haziq KXHL: sorry guys im not dealing with this well. been punching air and screaming into a pillow ever since the news broke. lots of people’s personal sacrifices made meaningless overnight
[3/2/26, 13:25:54] ~ samia 💗🌸: ‎This message was deleted.
[3/2/26, 13:26:44] ~ samia 💗🌸: this makes sense
[3/2/26, 13:27:12] ~ samia 💗🌸: especially when wealth inequality is sooo prevalent now
[3/2/26, 13:28:22] Haziq KXHL: *economic restructuring, same reason Alan Turing institute shifted from biomedical to weapons, according to them AI weapons higher ROI than women’s health
[3/2/26, 13:28:45] Haziq KXHL: **not false, just depraved
[3/2/26, 13:35:59] Haziq KXHL: more like higher ROI for the people who have the lobby / political capture. estimated economic burden of just endometriosis is billions annually. although it makes me sick to have to justify it like this
[3/2/26, 14:12:38] Haziq KXHL: there are two currents working against us right now.

wealth inequality

sociocultural shift. the west is not moving toward some progressive feminist utopia where women’s health is prioritised. support for DEI is dwindling. misogyny is explicit, open and acceptable. it is probably stupid of me to expect women’s health research to be protected in this climate.

US funding priorities set global funding priorities and we know how that’s going. i think Yanis Varoufakis is right that wealth inequality drives misogyny

[3/2/26, 14:33:50] Haziq KXHL: sorry i feel sick even theorising about this. a more elaborate story about why we got punched in the gut does not make it any less of a punch in the gut. i am not at arc anymore. you do not get to theorise when there is a neonatal icu next door
[3/2/26, 20:07:16] Alex KXHL: Came in contact with the enemy today
[3/2/26, 20:07:27] Alex KXHL: (UCL Claude Builder Club)
[3/2/26, 20:07:46] Niv Ucl Builder: WAIT THIS IS A THING?
‎[3/2/26, 20:08:02] Alex KXHL: ‎image omitted
[3/2/26, 20:08:10] Alex KXHL: They had a stall in ioe
[3/2/26, 20:08:17] Alex KXHL: Giving out sharpeners, pencils and stickers
[3/2/26, 20:08:41] Alex KXHL: And saying they'd give you a term of Claude pro if you joined or something
[3/2/26, 20:10:04] Niv Ucl Builder: okay ykw im ngl this is enticing
[3/2/26, 20:10:27] Alex KXHL: Only a term though
[3/2/26, 20:10:37] Alex KXHL: Ig it is free
[3/2/26, 20:11:53] Alex KXHL: But like Claude is establishing presence in UCL

[3/2/26, 21:04:47] Alex KXHL: Student center*** (idk why I hallucinated)
[3/2/26, 23:44:25] ~ Anna Magpie: God fucking damnit I'm gonna have to go all in on ML for synthetic biology if I ever want a job aren't o
[3/2/26, 23:45:09] Haziq KXHL: Actually…
[3/2/26, 23:46:05] Haziq KXHL: word is they are funnelling money away from MRC to EPSRC,
EPSRC is the one that funds synbio so you’re basically sequestering our money, shame on you genetic engineer 😤 ‎<This message was edited>
[3/2/26, 23:46:53] ~ Anna Magpie: This friday I guess I'm gonna come and start teaching myself to train neural nets to predict enhancer activity
[3/2/26, 23:48:57] ~ Anna Magpie: Tbh I kinda hate this, I'm a scientist at heart, not an engineer, but it increasingly looks like engineering is what will pay the bills
[3/2/26, 23:51:35] Haziq KXHL: i do think engineering mindset is an essential part of modern science, it’s just some fields (mine included) hardly have money for pipettes let alone applying an engineering approach
[3/2/26, 23:53:43] ~ Anna Magpie: Oh yea, engineering mindset is one thing, it's just that I get a lot more joy out of trying to understand how complicated systems work than from trying to work out how to build new systems. Like what I _actually_ wanna spend my time doing is getting into the weeds of the multilevel selection debates
[3/2/26, 23:54:44] Haziq KXHL: Tbh yes same if I didn’t have biomedical research commitments, then NASA Ames or SETI is where I would wanna be
[3/2/26, 23:54:55] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Yess!!! Accidentally doing engineering first was such a cheat code in life man!
[3/2/26, 23:55:59] ~ Anna Magpie: Also papers like this

[3/2/26, 23:56:04] Haziq KXHL: genuinely no grander question than the origin of life ‎<This message was edited>
[3/2/26, 23:57:28] ~ Anna Magpie: I was super into abiogenesis and then got frustrated with it but I wish the had the time to keep up with the field
[3/2/26, 23:57:55] Haziq KXHL: “Metabolic coordination and phase transitions in spatially distributed multi-cellular systems”
@⁨~Anna Magpie⁩ only natural sciences majors can appreciate such obscenely interdisciplinary shenanigans like that, i rate it 🤝
[3/2/26, 23:58:59] Haziq KXHL: Cronin’s assembly theory is all the buzz now if you wanna get back into it
[3/2/26, 23:59:11] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Wait what’s your theory for this? I told a math pro (her job is mathematically modelling the world) it’s ‘chance’ and I got accosted 😂
[4/2/26, 00:00:42] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Stochastic outcomes 🤷‍♂️
[4/2/26, 00:01:41] ~ Tuhan Sapumanage: Wait no if I do this I’ll chat for an hour. Goodnight people 😂
[4/2/26, 00:01:46] Haziq KXHL: i don’t think the state of scientific knowledge is at a place where we can posit a theory of the origin of life, im mostly concerned with the bounds and constraints any theory of the origin of life must satisfy
[4/2/26, 00:01:48] ~ Anna Magpie: Have you read Life at Low Reynolds number? You should, it's good
[4/2/26, 00:02:17] Haziq KXHL: will circle back on this…
[4/2/26, 00:02:48] ~ Anna Magpie: It's short and not very technical
